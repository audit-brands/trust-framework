# The Open Assurance Collective Individual Membership Program

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ The Vision: Support the Mission, Join the Collective

While our corporate sponsorship program helps to fund major initiatives, the heart of our ecosystem is the individual practitioner. This membership program is a grassroots way for you, the individual assurance professional, to directly support our mission and become a recognized patron of the open-source assurance movement.

Membership is about **patronage, not paywalls**. The entire framework will always be 100% free and accessible to everyone. A membership is your way of saying, "I believe in this mission, and I want to help it succeed."

Funds from individual memberships will be used to support our community infrastructure, such as our future Q&A platform, and to ensure the framework remains a vibrant and sustainable resource for all.
