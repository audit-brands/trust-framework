# The Open Assurance Collective Framework

**An open, community-driven framework with practical, AI-enhanced tooling that revolutionizes the assurance profession. By the community, for the community.**

---

## The Vision: A Modern Alternative to Traditional Assurance

The world of risk is dynamic, but the standards and tools for assurance have remained static for too long. Traditional, compliance-focused auditing is failing to keep pace with the speed of modern business.

**The Open Assurance Collective is a movement to change that.**

Our mission is to create a transparent, community-driven alternative to the closed, proprietary standards that have dominated the profession. We are building an ecosystem of practical, technology-native tools and methodologies that empower assurance professionals to create demonstrable value, not just check boxes.

This is more than a new standard; it is a new way of working.

## The Ecosystem: Two Pillars, One Mission

The Open Assurance Collective ecosystem is built on two core pillars that work together to bridge philosophy and practice:

| Pillar | Description | Who It's For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🏛️ **The `trust-framework`** | The philosophical and practical foundation of the initiative. It contains the principles, standards (`modules`), and engagement templates (`patterns`) for a modern assurance profession. This is the "what" and the "why." | **Assurance & Risk Professionals:** Audit, GRC, and controls experts who want to adopt a modern, value-focused methodology. |
| 🛠️ **The `trust-cli` Engine** | The official, local-first AI tool to implement the framework. It automates workflows, scaffolds engagements, and brings the principles to life. This is the "how." | **Technologists & Power Users:** Engineers, data scientists, and hands-on practitioners who want to execute assurance work with speed and precision. |

## Getting Started: Choose Your Path

We invite you to engage with the framework in a way that best suits your role and interests.

### **Path 1: Understand the Philosophy**
*I want to learn the "why" behind The Open Assurance Collective.*

### **Path 3: Contribute to the Framework**
*I want to help shape the future of assurance.*

This is a community-driven effort, and we need your expertise.
1.  Read our **[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** to get started.
2.  Propose a new **[Module](modules/)** for a specific risk area (e.g., cloud security, data privacy).
3.  Share a best-practice **[Pattern](patterns/)** for a common engagement (e.g., a SOC 2 audit, an AI model review).
4.  Help us improve the framework by opening an issue or a pull request.
