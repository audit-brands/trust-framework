# Trust: An Open System for Modern Assurance

---

Trust is a modular, open-source framework for building trust through modern assurance. It combines control design, system feedback, and stakeholder outcomes that go beyond compliance. This repository contains the core modules, patterns, tools, and the principles behind Trust — a community-driven system for modern assurance and control design. This framework is created by assurance practitioners for audit practitioners.

## 🔧 What's Inside

**Trust Framework**: Principles, modules, and patterns for trust-driven assurance
**Technical Tools**: Local-first implementations including the trust-cli AI assistant
