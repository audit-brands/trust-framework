## üéØ The Vision: Investing in the Future of Assurance

The Open Assurance Collective is a community-driven movement to build the open-source operating system for the future of the assurance profession. Our mission is to provide free, practical, and modern tools and standards for every risk, audit, and compliance professional in the world.

To ensure the long-term health and sustainability of this project, we have launched our sponsorship program. Sponsorship is not just about financial support; it is a partnership. By sponsoring the framework, you are investing in the future of the profession and demonstrating your organization's commitment to open standards, community collaboration, and modern assurance practices.

Funds from this program will be used to support the ecosystem, including:

*   Maintaining the infrastructure for community platforms like our future Q&A site.
*   Funding development on the `trust-cli` and the Open Assurance Collective Server.
*   Supporting community events and outreach.
