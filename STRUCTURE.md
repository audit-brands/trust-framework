# TrustOS Framework Structure

**Version 1.0 ‚Äî Modular, Open, and Community-Driven**

TrustOS is organized into **three core layers**, each inspired by modern systems engineering and open-source software architecture. This modular approach allows users to adopt, extend, or remix TrustOS components based on their specific needs, industry, or maturity level.

---

## üß≠ Layer 1: Core Principles

The foundation of TrustOS. This layer defines the shared values, beliefs, and design commitments that guide all other components.

### Includes:
- TrustOS Manifesto
- Governance and contribution rules
- Brand usage policy
- Philosophy of trust-by-design and outcome-oriented assurance

---

## üß± Layer 2: Functional Modules

Reusable building blocks that support control design, maturity assessment, reporting strategy, stakeholder alignment, and digital governance.

### Examples:
- Control Maturity 2.0 Model
- Adaptive Controls Toolkit
- Stakeholder-Centered Reporting Module
- Behavioral Risk & Culture Module
- AI and Algorithmic Assurance
- ESG Trust Framework
- Pattern tagging for industries, regions, and standards

### Format:
Markdown files, interactive checklists, worksheets, and visual models.

---

## üîÅ Layer 3: Practice Patterns

Real-world, scenario-based audit and assurance blueprints that combine design logic, stakeholder goals, and iterative learning.

### Examples:
- Ethical AI Audit Pattern
- Agile Development Risk Pattern
- Psychological Safety & Culture Pulse
- Third-Party Risk and Trust Pattern
- Algorithmic Bias Testing Workflow

### Format:
- Markdown pattern files with YAML metadata headers
- Optional industry/region tags
- Audit steps, rationale, KPIs, and feedback loop

## How the Layers Work Together

- **Core Principles** guide everything (like an Operating System (OS) kernel)
- **Modules** are shared components and models
- **Patterns** are the user interface‚Äîapplied, tailored, and iterated by teams in the field

All layers are **open**, **versioned**, and **community-extensible**.
