# TrustOS Framework Structure

**Version 1.0 ‚Äî Modular, Open, and Community-Driven**

TrustOS is organized into **three core layers**, each inspired by modern systems engineering and open-source software architecture. The architecture of TrustOS ‚Äî including Core Principles, Functional Modules, and Practice Patterns. This modular approach allows users to adopt, extend, or remix TrustOS components based on their specific needs, industry, or maturity level.

Additionally, TrustOS includes **technical tools** that implement these principles in code, providing practical implementations for teams who want to operationalize trust-driven assurance.

---

## üß≠ Layer 1: Core Principles

The foundation of TrustOS. This layer defines the shared values, beliefs, and design commitments that guide all other components.

### Includes:
- TrustOS Manifesto
- Governance and contribution rules
- Brand usage policy
- Philosophy of trust-by-design and outcome-oriented assurance

---

## üß± Layer 2: Functional Modules

Reusable building blocks that support control design, maturity assessment, reporting strategy, stakeholder alignment, and digital governance.

### Examples:
- Control Maturity 2.0 Model
- Adaptive Controls Toolkit
- Stakeholder-Centered Reporting Module
- Behavioral Risk & Culture Module
- AI and Algorithmic Assurance
- ESG Trust Framework
- Pattern tagging for industries, regions, and standards

### Format:
Markdown files, interactive checklists, worksheets, and visual models.

---

## üîÅ Layer 3: Practice Patterns

Real-world, scenario-based audit and assurance blueprints that combine design logic, stakeholder goals, and iterative learning.

### Examples:
- Ethical AI Audit Pattern
- Agile Development Risk Pattern
- Psychological Safety & Culture Pulse
- Third-Party Risk and Trust Pattern
- Algorithmic Bias Testing Workflow

### Format:
- Markdown pattern files with YAML metadata headers
- Optional industry/region tags
- Audit steps, rationale, KPIs, and feedback loop

---

## How the Layers Work Together

- **Core Principles** guide everything (like an Operating System (OS) kernel)
- **Modules** are shared components and models
- **Patterns** are the user interface‚Äîapplied, tailored, and iterated by teams in the field

All layers are **open**, **versioned**, and **community-extensible**.

---

## üîß Technical Tools

Practical implementations of TrustOS principles in code, designed for teams who want to operationalize trust-driven assurance.

### Current Tools:
- **trust-cli**: A local-first AI CLI assistant that embodies TrustOS privacy and transparency principles
- More tools coming soon...

### Philosophy:
- **Privacy-first**: All processing happens locally when possible
- **Transparency**: Open source, auditable implementations
- **Trust-by-design**: Security and privacy built into the architecture
- **Community-driven**: Open contribution and governance model
