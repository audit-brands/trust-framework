# Trust Methodology System v1.0.0
**Complete Local Development Methodology**

A comprehensive local file-based issue tracking system implementing the Every.to team's development methodology, designed for Claude Code integration while keeping sensitive code private.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Projects
```bash
# Set up Trust methodology in any project
./setup_new_project.sh /path/to/your/project "Project Name"

# Example
./setup_new_project.sh /Users/username/Development/my_awesome_project "My Awesome Project"
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Copy this entire directory to your project
cp -r . /path/to/your/project/trustos_system
cd /path/to/your/project/trustos_system
./scripts/init-issues.sh "Your Project Name"
```

## 🛠️ System Commands

### Issue Management
```bash
# Create comprehensive issues with AI research
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Add user authentication" high "feature,backend"

# List and filter issues
./scripts/list-issues.sh backlog --format=brief
./scripts/list-issues.sh --stats

# Move through workflow
./scripts/move-issue.sh 1 in-progress "Starting implementation"
./scripts/move-issue.sh 1 review "Ready for testing"
./scripts/move-issue.sh 1 done "Completed successfully"

# Search everything
./scripts/search-issues.sh "authentication"
./scripts/search-issues.sh --recent=5
```

### System Information
```bash
# Check system version and health
./scripts/version.sh

# Get help

./scripts/search-issues.sh --help
```

## 🎨 Claude Code Integration

Set up these custom commands in Claude Code:

1. **`/local-issue-create`** - AI-powered issue creation with 15-20 minute research phase
2. **`/issue-manage`** - Issue listing, filtering, and status management  
3. **`/dev-workflow`** - Development lifecycle management
4. **`/project-status`** - Comprehensive project reporting

*See `docs/local_custom_commands.md` for complete command definitions*

## 📖 Documentation

- **[Implementation Runbook](docs/implementation_runbook.md)** - Complete step-by-step setup
- **[Custom Commands](docs/local_custom_commands.md)** - Claude Code integration guide
- **[Development Process](docs/trustos_development_process.md)** - Core methodology principles
- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** - Complete feature documentation

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Git** - Version control integration
- **jq** - JSON processing for configuration
- **Claude Code Pro/Max** - For unlimited AI agent usage

Install dependencies:
```bash
# macOS
brew install git jq

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install git jq
```

## 🎯 Workflow

```
1. IDEA → /local-issue-create "Feature description"
   ↓ (AI researches codebase and best practices for 15-20 minutes)

2. REVIEW → Human reviews the comprehensive issue plan  
   ↓ (Catch problems early - "fix at lowest value stage")

3. IMPLEMENT → /dev-workflow Start working on issue X
   ↓ (Move to in-progress, create branch, begin coding)

4. COMPLETE → /dev-workflow Complete issue X
   ↓ (Move to done, merge branch, clean up)

5. COMPOUND → Use learnings to improve future prompts
   ↓ (Each task makes the next easier)
```
