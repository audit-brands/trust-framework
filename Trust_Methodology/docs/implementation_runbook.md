# Trust Development Process - Local Implementation Runbook

This runbook provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Trust development process using a local file-based issue tracking system, based on insights from the Every.to team's workflow.

## Overview

The Trust methodology emphasizes:
- **Compounding engineering**: Each task makes future tasks easier
- **Research-first approach**: Thorough planning before implementation
- **Human review checkpoints**: Catch problems early in the process
- **Autonomous execution**: Long-running AI agents with minimal intervention
- **Local privacy**: Keep sensitive code private while maintaining professional workflows

## Phase 1: System Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Required Software**
   ```bash
   # Check if installed
   git --version
   jq --version
   
   # Install if missing (macOS)
   brew install git jq
   
   # Install if missing (Ubuntu)
   sudo apt-get install git jq
   ```

2. **Claude Code Subscription**
   - Ensure you have Claude Code Pro/Max for unlimited usage
   - This is essential for the long-running agent workflows

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

1. **Navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Copy the Trust system files**
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire trust_methodology_system to your project
   cp -r /path/to/trust_methodology_system ./trust_system
   cd trust_system
   ```

3. **Run the initialization script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init-issues.sh "Your Project Name"
   ```

4. **Verify the setup**
   ```bash
   # Check directory structure
   ls -la .issues/
   
   # Test issue creation
   ./scripts/create-issue.sh "Test issue" medium "test"
   
   # Test issue listing
   ./scripts/list-issues.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Code Custom Commands

1. **Start Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Add the Local Issue Creation Command**
   ```
   /config add-command local-issue-create "Local Issue Creation Command"
   ```
   *Paste the full LCI command from `docs/local_custom_commands.md`*

3. **Add the Issue Management Command**
   ```
   /config add-command issue-manage "Issue Management Command"
   ```
   *Paste the full IMC command from `docs/local_custom_commands.md`*

4. **Add the Development Workflow Command**
   ```
   /config add-command dev-workflow "Development Workflow Command"
   ```
   *Paste the full DWC command from `docs/local_custom_commands.md`*

5. **Add the Project Status Command**
   ```
   /config add-command project-status "Project Status Command"
   ```
   *Paste the full PSC command from `docs/local_custom_commands.md`*

6. **Test the commands**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Add a simple test feature to verify the workflow
   ```

## Phase 2: Workflow Implementation

### The Trust Development Cycle

```
Idea → Research → Plan → Review → Implement → Test → Deploy
  ↑                                                       ↓
  ←←←←←←←←←←←← Compound Learning ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### Step 1: Create Your First Real Issue

1. **Use natural language description**
   ```
   /local-issue-create I need to add user authentication to the application with login and signup forms
   ```

2. **Let Claude Code run the full research cycle** (15-20 minutes expected)
   - Codebase analysis
   - Best practices research
   - Requirements gathering
   - Technical planning

3. **Review the generated issue**
   - Read the created markdown file in `.issues/backlog/`
   - Check that the technical approach makes sense
   - Verify requirements are complete
   - Approve or request modifications

### Step 2: Implement the Workflow

1. **Start development**
   ```
   /dev-workflow Start working on issue 2
   ```
   *This will move the issue to in-progress and create a feature branch*

2. **Follow the implementation plan**
   - Open the issue file to reference the technical plan
   - Implement following the specified steps
   - Run tests as outlined in the testing strategy

3. **Commit regularly**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement user signup form - Part of ISSUE-2"
   ```

4. **Move to review when ready**
   ```
   /issue-manage Move issue 2 to review with comment "Initial implementation complete, ready for testing"
   ```

5. **Complete the issue**
   ```
   /dev-workflow Complete issue 2
   ```
   *This will move to done, merge branches, and clean up*

### Step 3: Build Compound Workflows

1. **Create meta-prompts for common patterns**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Create a reusable authentication component that other features can use
   ```

2. **Build on previous work**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Add social login options using the authentication system from issue 2
   ```

3. **Create workflow automation issues**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Set up automated testing pipeline for authentication features
   ```

## Phase 3: Advanced Usage

### Parallel Development

1. **Run multiple Claude Code instances**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   claude
   /local-issue-create Feature A

   # Terminal 2  
   claude
   /local-issue-create Feature B

   # Terminal 3
   claude
   /dev-workflow Implement issue 5
   ```

2. **Coordinate using the issue system**
   ```
   /project-status
   ```
   *Get overview of all parallel work*

### Quality Assurance Integration

1. **Create testing issues**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Write comprehensive test suite for user authentication system
   ```

2. **Add evaluation workflows**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Create automated prompt evaluation system for our custom commands
   ```

3. **Build monitoring issues**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Set up performance monitoring for authentication endpoints
   ```

### Collaboration Workflows

1. **Export issue summaries for team review**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/list-issues.sh --format=json > weekly_report.json
   ```

2. **Create handoff documentation**
   ```
   /local-issue-create Document the Trust methodology implementation for team onboarding
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Scripts not executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. **jq not found**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install jq
   
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install jq
   ```

3. **Git not initialized**
   ```bash
   git init
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

4. **Claude Code commands not working**
   - Verify the commands were added correctly with `/config list-commands`
   - Check that you're in the correct directory with `.issues/` folder
   - Ensure scripts are executable

### Performance Optimization

1. **Long-running Claude Code sessions**
   - Aim for 15-25 minute runs
   - Include comprehensive testing in prompts
   - Use specific, detailed prompts

2. **Issue organization**
   ```bash
   # Regular cleanup
   ./scripts/search-issues.sh --recent=20
   
   # Archive old completed issues
   mkdir .issues/archive
   mv .issues/done/old-issue-*.md .issues/archive/
   ```

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure Trust methodology effectiveness:

### Quantitative Metrics
```bash
# Issue velocity
./scripts/list-issues.sh --stats

# Recent activity
./scripts/search-issues.sh --recent=10

# Git activity
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | wc -l
```

### Qualitative Metrics
- Time from idea to implementation
- Quality of generated issue plans
- Reduction in debugging time
- Frequency of requirement changes during implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Master basic issue creation and workflow
2. **Week 2**: Build first compound workflows (prompts that generate prompts)
3. **Week 3**: Implement parallel development with multiple agents
4. **Week 4**: Create team collaboration and handoff processes

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Labels and Workflows
Edit `.issues/config.json` to add project-specific labels:
```json
{
  "labels": [
    "frontend",
    "backend", 
    "database",
    "security",
    "performance",
    "your-custom-labels"
  ]
}
```

### Integration with External Tools
```bash
# Export to project management tools
./scripts/list-issues.sh --format=json | your-integration-script

# Sync with team tools
./scripts/search-issues.sh "status:done" --format=json | generate-report
```

### Team Workflows
```bash
# Daily standup data
./scripts/search-issues.sh --recent=1

# Sprint planning
./scripts/list-issues.sh backlog --format=brief

# Retrospective data
./scripts/search-issues.sh "priority:high" --status=done
```

*Remember: The key to Trust methodology success is consistent use and continuous refinement of your prompts and workflows. Each project teaches you how to make the next project faster and more effective.*
