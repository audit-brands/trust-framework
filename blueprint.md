# Trust Blueprint

**Version 1.0 — A Modular System for Assurance, Insight, and Trust**

Trust is an open-source, modular assurance framework designed for today’s fast-moving, data-rich, and trust-challenged organizations. Inspired by systems engineering and open governance, Trust provides a structured way to design, evaluate, and evolve trust mechanisms in complex environments.

## 🧭 Three-Layer Architecture

### 1. Core Principles
Defines the vision, values, and philosophy that shape Trust.

- [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md)
- [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)
- [BRAND_USAGE.md](BRAND_USAGE.md)

---

### 2. Functional Modules
Reusable building blocks for designing and managing controls and assurance systems.

- [control_design_maturity.md](control_design_maturity.md) — Control Maturity 2.0, cybernetic controls, improvement tools
- Stakeholder-Centered Reporting
- Culture & Behavior Risk
- ESG Trust Framework
- Algorithmic and AI Governance

Each module is written in Markdown, version-controlled, and includes:
- Use cases
- Implementation patterns
- Checklists and templates
- Optional YAML tagging for industry/region

---

### 3. Practice Patterns
Scenario-based blueprints that combine control design with feedback loops, KPIs, and human factors.

Examples:
- Ethical AI Audit Pattern
- Agile Development Risk Pattern
- Retention Risk and Margin Dilution
- Third-Party Trust and Continuous Monitoring

Patterns contain:
- Audit logic
- Embedded learning loops
- KPIs and leading indicators
- Suggested maturity progression

## 🎯 Design Goals

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Open | Everything is markdown-based, forkable, remixable |
| Adaptive | Maturity is dynamic, not checklist-based |
| Insight-Oriented | Control effectiveness tied to learning, not status |
| Community-Built | Open for audit pros, engineers, designers, and risk leaders |
| Trust-Centric | Outcome is trust—not just compliance or independence |

---

## 🛤️ Roadmap (v1.0 – v1.2)

- ✅ Publish core layers and initial modules (v1.0)
- 🚧 Add pattern contribution schema and metadata tagging (v1.1)
- 🚀 Create localization and industry overlays (v1.2)
