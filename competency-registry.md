# OpenAudit Competency Registry

**Version:** 1.0

## üéØ Philosophy: Recognizing Contribution Over Credentials

In the OpenAudit ecosystem, we believe that true expertise is demonstrated through contribution, not just by passing a test. This Competency Registry is a living document that recognizes and celebrates the individuals who are actively building the future of the assurance profession.

Unlike traditional certifications, which are static and based on a single point in time, this registry is dynamic. It is updated continuously to reflect the real-world contributions and demonstrated competencies of our community members. Our goal is to create a credential that is more valuable because it is earned through transparent, peer-validated work.

For more information on the philosophy behind this approach, please see the **[OpenAudit Competency Framework](core/OPENAUDIT_COMPETENCY_FRAMEWORK.md)**.

## üìà A Phased Approach to Competency

This registry will evolve over time. We are taking a phased approach to building this new model for professional recognition.

*   **Phase 1 (Current): A Manual, GitHub-Based Registry**
    *   **Platform:** This markdown file serves as the official, transparent ledger.
    *   **Recognition:** Recognition is based on direct contributions to the `trust-framework` repository (e.g., authoring a new module or pattern).
    *   **Review:** Contributions are reviewed and approved by the project maintainers based on their quality, impact, and alignment with the OpenAudit philosophy. A merged pull request is the current form of "validation."
    *   **Requirement:** A GitHub account is required to contribute directly to the framework content.

*   **Phase 2 (Future): A Dedicated, Community-Driven Platform**
    *   **Platform:** We will launch a dedicated Q&A platform (see our **[strategy document](strategy-q-and-a-platform.md)**) to serve as the primary hub for community interaction.
    *   **Recognition:** Competency will be recognized based on a combination of direct framework contributions and activity on the Q&A platform (e.g., upvoted answers, accepted solutions).
    *   **Review:** The community itself will play a larger role in validating contributions through voting mechanisms on the Q&A platform.
    *   **Requirement:** A GitHub account will **not** be required to participate in the Q&A community, lowering the barrier to entry for all assurance professionals.

##  How to Earn Recognition (Current Phase 1 Process)

Recognition in this registry is earned, not given. If you would like to be recognized for your work, here is how to get started:

1.  **Make a Contribution:** The first step is to make a meaningful contribution to the framework. Please see our **[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for more information.
2.  **Submit for Review:** Once your contribution has been accepted, you can open an issue in the `trust-framework` repository with the title "Competency Registry Submission." In the issue, please include:
    *   A link to your merged pull request(s).
    *   A brief summary of the competencies you believe you have demonstrated through your work.
3.  **Community Review:** A maintainer will review your submission and, if approved, will add your profile to this registry.
