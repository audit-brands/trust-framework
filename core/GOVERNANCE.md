# Trust Governance

**Version 1.0**

Trust is an open framework for building trust through assurance. It is developed and maintained by a growing community of contributors who believe that governance, risk, and control systems should be transparent, adaptive, and stakeholder-focused. Learn about our open contribution model, roles (steward, contributors, maintainers), and decision-making process.

## Guiding Principles

- **Open by Default**: All decisions, contributions, and discussions are public and forkable.
- **Community-Driven**: No single entity owns Trust; leadership emerges through contribution.
- **Mission-First**: We prioritize outcomes that increase trust, insight, and impact—not bureaucracy.
- **Respectful Participation**: Contributors are expected to engage constructively and transparently.

## Contribution Structure

- **Maintainers**: Trusted contributors who review pull requests, manage releases, and uphold community norms.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits an issue, pull request, pattern, or discussion item.
- **Steward**: The original founder (currently Jamie Ontiveros) acts as interim steward for roadmap direction and brand protection.

All contributions are welcome. For significant changes, open an issue first to start a discussion.

## Decision-Making

- **Consensus Seeking**: We aim for consensus among maintainers for major changes.
- **Pull Requests**: Accepted based on clarity, value alignment, and practical utility.
- **Open and Extensible**: You are encouraged to fork, remix, or build on Trust for your own use case—with attribution.

## Use of the Name “Trust”

To preserve the integrity and vision of the project:

- You may **not** use the name “Trust” to describe a closed-source fork or proprietary variant without written permission.
- Derivative projects must clearly distinguish themselves unless they contribute back to the core.
- You **can** use the name to reference or cite the framework in educational, community, or academic work with attribution.

The name and logo may be trademarked in the future to prevent misuse.

## How to Become a Maintainer

Contributors who demonstrate sustained, thoughtful participation may be invited to become maintainers.

## Changes to Governance

This document may evolve. Proposed changes should be submitted via pull request and discussed in a public issue.

**Let’s build trust by building together. Audit forward.**
