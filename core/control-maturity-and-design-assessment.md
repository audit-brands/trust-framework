# Core Tool: Control Maturity & Design Assessment

**Version:** 2.0

---

## üéØ Objective

This document provides a reusable, pattern-agnostic worksheet for assessing the design and maturity of any control or business process. It replaces outdated, static maturity concepts with a modern, **cybernetic perspective**‚Äîtreating controls as dynamic components of a system that can learn, respond, and self-correct.

This tool is designed to be used within the context of a specific engagement pattern to help auditors and control owners evaluate the current state of a control environment and define a clear path for improvement.

## üìà The Control Maturity Model

This model provides a consistent language for assessing control maturity. The goal is to move controls from being manual and reactive to being automated, adaptive, and, ultimately, self-correcting.

| Level | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Absent** | No control exists. The risk is unmanaged. |
| **1** | **Manual & Reactive** | The control is performed by a human, often inconsistently, and is typically triggered only after a failure or issue has been detected. |
| **2** | **Automated & Preventative** | The control is automated based on static rules. It can prevent known bad things from happening but cannot adapt to new scenarios. |
| **3** | **Integrated & Monitored** | The control is embedded directly into business systems and generates performance data. We have visibility into whether the control is working. |
| **4** | **Adaptive & Data-Informed** | The control can automatically adjust its behavior or thresholds based on new data or observed activity over time. |
| **5** | **Cybernetic (Self-Correcting)** | The control can sense its environment, respond to changes, learn from outcomes, and evolve its own rules with minimal human intervention. |

## üìù Control Assessment Worksheet

*Use one copy of this worksheet for each key control or process being reviewed.*

### 1. Control Description

*   **Control / Process Name:** `[e.g., User Access Review]`
*   **Control Owner:** `[e.g., Head of IT]`
*   **Control Objective:** `[e.g., To ensure that only active, authorized users have access to critical systems.]`

### 2. Current State Analysis

*   **How does the control currently work?**
    *   `[Describe the current process in detail. Who does what? What systems are involved?]`

*   **Current Maturity Assessment:**
    *   **Level:** `[Choose a level from the model above, e.g., Level 1: Manual & Reactive]`
    *   **Justification:** `[Explain why you chose this level, citing specific evidence from the current process.]`

*   **Identified Gaps & Risks:**
    *   `[What are the weaknesses of the current approach? What risks does this create? e.g., "The process is only performed annually, creating a large window for standing access to go undetected."]`

### 3. Future State & Improvement Plan

*   **Proposed Next Step (The +1 Upgrade):**
    *   **Description:** `[What is the single most important improvement that can be made to move the control to the next maturity level? e.g., "Automate the generation of user access lists from the source systems."]`
    *   **Target Maturity Level:** `[e.g., Level 2: Automated & Preventative]`

*   **The Long-Term Vision (The Path to Level 5):**
    *   **Description:** `[What would a truly cybernetic, self-correcting version of this control look like? e.g., "A system that continuously monitors user activity, automatically de-provisions inactive accounts, and uses machine learning to flag anomalous access patterns for review."]`

*   **Action Plan:**
    *   **Owner:** `[Who is responsible for driving the improvement?]`
    *   **Timeline:** `[What is the target date for the next step?]`
    *   **Dependencies:** `[What other teams or resources are needed?]`
