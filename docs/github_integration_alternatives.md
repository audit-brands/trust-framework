# GitHub Integration Workflow Alternatives

## The Problem
The Every.to team used GitHub's issue tracking, project boards, and PR workflows. Local Git repositories don't have these features built-in.

## Option 1: Free GitHub Account (Recommended)
Even without a paid GitHub account, you can create free repositories with full issue tracking.

### Setup Steps:
1. Create free GitHub account at github.com
2. Create repository for your project
3. Push local Git repo to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Benefits:
- Full issue tracking with labels, assignments, milestones
- Project boards for Kanban workflow  
- Pull request workflow with code reviews
- Integration with Claude Code's GitHub tools
- Can still work locally and push when ready

## Option 2: Local File-Based Issue Tracking
If GitHub isn't viable, create a local system that mimics the workflow.

### File Structure:
```
project/
├── .issues/
│   ├── backlog/
│   ├── in-progress/
│   ├── review/
│   └── done/
├── .templates/
│   └── issue-template.md
└── scripts/
    ├── create-issue.sh
    └── move-issue.sh
```

### Issue Template (.templates/issue-template.md):
```markdown
---
id: ISSUE-001
title: [Title]
status: backlog
priority: medium
created: 2025-01-16
---

### Scripts for Issue Management:

**create-issue.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ISSUE_ID="ISSUE-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
TITLE="$1"
FILE=".issues/backlog/${ISSUE_ID}-${TITLE// /-}.md"

cp .templates/issue-template.md "$FILE"
sed -i "s/ISSUE-001/$ISSUE_ID/g" "$FILE"
sed -i "s/\[Title\]/$TITLE/g" "$FILE"
sed -i "s/2025-01-16/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/g" "$FILE"

echo "Created issue: $FILE"
```

**move-issue.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ISSUE_FILE="$1"
NEW_STATUS="$2"

mv "$ISSUE_FILE" ".issues/$NEW_STATUS/"
sed -i "s/status: .*/status: $NEW_STATUS/g" ".issues/$NEW_STATUS/$(basename $ISSUE_FILE)"
```

## Option 3: Modified Custom Command for Local Files
Update the Issue Creation Command to work with local files:

```markdown
# Modified Issue Creation Command (Local Files)

[Same research and planning steps as original]

### 5. Generate Local Issue File
Instead of creating a GitHub issue, create a local markdown file in `.issues/backlog/` with the comprehensive format.

### 6. Git Integration
After creating the issue file:
- Add file to git: `git add .issues/backlog/[filename]`
- Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Add issue: [title]"`
- Optionally create branch for implementation: `git checkout -b feature/[issue-id]`
```

## Option 4: Third-Party Tools
Consider lightweight alternatives:
- **GitLab** (free with built-in issues)
- **Linear** (excellent issue tracking)
- **Notion** (database-style issue tracking)
- **Obsidian** with templates (local markdown)

## Recommended Approach

**For Phase 1**: Start with **Option 1 (Free GitHub)** because:
- Zero cost for public repos or small private repos
- Full feature parity with Every.to workflow
- Claude Code has native GitHub integration
- Easy to invite collaborators later
- Professional workflow from day one

**If GitHub isn't possible**: Use **Option 2 (Local Files)** with these modifications to the original workflow:
- Replace "Create GitHub issue" with "Create local issue file"
- Use git branches for feature development
- Use commit messages for tracking progress
- Create simple shell scripts for issue management

## Implementation Steps

### For GitHub Integration:
1. Create GitHub account and repository
2. Push existing code to GitHub
3. Test Claude Code GitHub commands:
   ```
   what issues are open in this repository?
   create a new issue titled "test issue"
   ```

### For Local File System:
1. Create `.issues/` directory structure
2. Set up issue template
3. Create helper scripts
4. Test custom command with local file output

*The key is maintaining the research → planning → review → implementation workflow regardless of the tracking system used.*
