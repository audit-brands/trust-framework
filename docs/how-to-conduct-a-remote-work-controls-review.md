# How to Conduct a Remote Work Controls Review with the OpenAudit Framework

**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the OpenAudit framework to conduct a review of the key controls and risks associated with a remote or hybrid work environment. It is designed for assurance professionals, IT managers, and HR leaders.

This guide will use the **[remote-work-controls](../patterns/remote-work-controls/README.md)** engagement pattern as its foundation.

--- 

## ðŸš€ The Overall Process

Conducting a remote work controls review with the OpenAudit framework follows a simple, agile process:

1.  **Understand the Scope:** Review the engagement pattern to understand the key risk domains.
2.  **Plan Your Sprints:** Break the review down into a series of focused, time-boxed sprints.
3.  **Execute the Sprints:** Use the detailed work programs to guide your testing and analysis.
4.  **Communicate Continuously:** Deliver insights and recommendations as you discover them.

## Step 1: Understand the Scope & Key Domains

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the three core domains of the `remote-work-controls` pattern:

1.  **[Secure Access & Endpoints](../patterns/remote-work-controls/work-program-domain-secure-access-endpoints.md):** The security of remote access solutions and endpoint devices.
2.  **[Data Protection & Communications](../patterns/remote-work-controls/work-program-domain-data-protection-communications.md):** The controls that protect data and communications in a remote environment.
3.  **[People & Policy](../patterns/remote-work-controls/work-program-domain-people-policy.md):** The HR policies, training, and cultural aspects of remote work.

## Step 2: Plan Your Sprints

Break the review into a series of short sprints, each focused on a specific aspect of the remote work environment.

**Example Sprint Plan:**

*   **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): The Technical Foundation**
    *   **Goal:** To validate the security of the technical controls for remote work, including the VPN and endpoint security.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-secure-access-endpoints.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): The Human Element**
    *   **Goal:** To review the policies, training, and cultural aspects of remote work.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-people-policy.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Data Protection & Wrap-up**
    *   **Goal:** To assess the effectiveness of data protection controls and synthesize all findings.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-data-protection-communications.md` to guide your work. Consolidate all findings and prepare the final summary.

For more detailed guidance on planning and running sprints, refer to the **[audit-sprint-planning-guide.md](../modules/agile-auditing/audit-sprint-planning-guide.md)**.

## Step 3: Execute the Sprints & Use the Work Programs

For each sprint, use the corresponding work program from the pattern as your guide. These work programs provide:

*   **Key Risks:** To help you focus on the most significant remote work risks.
*   **Control Objectives:** To define what a "good" control looks like in a remote context.
*   **Suggested Testing Procedures:** To provide a clear, actionable set of steps for your review.

## Step 4: Communicate for Impact

Remote work involves a wide range of stakeholders, from IT and Security to HR and business line managers.

*   **Engage a Cross-Functional Team:** This is not just an IT audit. Involve HR and business managers from the beginning to ensure that your recommendations are practical and address the full spectrum of remote work challenges.
*   **Focus on Enablement, Not Just Control:** Frame your recommendations in a way that helps the business to work more effectively and securely in a remote environment, rather than simply imposing new restrictions.
*   **Use the Right Language:** Tailor your communication to the audience. An IT manager will need technical details, while an HR leader will be more interested in the impact on employee experience.

By following this process, you can conduct a remote work controls review that helps your organization to thrive in the modern, distributed world of work.
