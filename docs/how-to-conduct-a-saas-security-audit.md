# How to Conduct a SaaS Security Audit with the OpenAudit Framework

**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the OpenAudit framework to conduct a security audit of a modern SaaS application. It is designed for assurance professionals, security teams, and anyone who needs to assess the security posture of a SaaS product.

This guide will use the **[saas-security-audit](../patterns/saas-security-audit/README.md)** engagement pattern as its foundation.

--- 

## ðŸš€ The Overall Process

Conducting an audit with the OpenAudit framework follows a simple, agile process:

1.  **Understand the Scope:** Review the engagement pattern to understand the key risk domains.
2.  **Plan Your Sprints:** Break the audit down into a series of focused, time-boxed sprints.
3.  **Execute the Sprints:** Use the detailed work programs to guide your testing and analysis.
4.  **Communicate Continuously:** Deliver insights and recommendations as you discover them, rather than waiting for a final report.

## Step 1: Understand the Scope & Key Domains

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the five core domains of the `saas-security-audit` pattern:

1.  **[Infrastructure & Cloud Configuration](../patterns/saas-security-audit/work-program-domain-infra-cloud.md):** The security of the underlying cloud environment.
2.  **[Application & Code Security](../patterns/saas-security-audit/work-program-domain-app-code-security.md):** The security of the application code and software supply chain.
3.  **[Data Security & Privacy](../patterns/saas-security-audit/work-program-domain-data-security-privacy.md):** The protection of sensitive data.
4.  **[Identity & Access Management](../patterns/saas-security-audit/work-program-domain-iam.md):** The controls over who can access what.
5.  **[Incident Response & Business Continuity](../patterns/saas-security-audit/work-program-domain-incident-response.md):** The organization's ability to respond to and recover from incidents.

## Step 2: Plan Your Sprints

Instead of a single, long fieldwork phase, you will break the audit into a series of 2-week sprints. Each sprint will focus on one or two of the core domains.

**Example Sprint Plan:**

*   **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Infrastructure & Cloud Configuration**
    *   **Goal:** To validate the security of the production AWS environment.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-infra-cloud.md` to guide your work. Focus on network security and secure configuration.

*   **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Application & Code Security**
    *   **Goal:** To assess the security of the CI/CD pipeline and the process for managing vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-app-code-security.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Data Security & IAM**
    *   **Goal:** To verify that customer data is encrypted and that access controls are based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-data-security-privacy.md` and `work-program-domain-iam.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Incident Response & Wrap-up**
    *   **Goal:** To test the incident response plan and synthesize all findings.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-incident-response.md` to conduct a tabletop exercise. Consolidate all findings and prepare the final summary.

For more detailed guidance on planning and running sprints, refer to the **[audit-sprint-planning-guide.md](../modules/agile-auditing/audit-sprint-planning-guide.md)**.

## Step 3: Execute the Sprints & Use the Work Programs

For each sprint, use the corresponding work program from the pattern as your guide. These work programs provide:

*   **Key Risks:** To help you focus on what matters most.
*   **Control Objectives:** To define what a "good" control looks like.
*   **Suggested Testing Procedures:** To provide a clear, actionable set of steps for your testing.

Remember to be agile. The work programs are a guide, not a rigid checklist. If you discover a new risk or a more effective way to test a control, adapt your approach accordingly.

## Step 4: Communicate for Impact

Do not wait until the end of the audit to share your findings. Use the principles from the **[communicating-for-impact-guide.md](../modules/stakeholder-centric/communicating-for-impact-guide.md)** to deliver value throughout the process:

*   **At the end of each sprint,** hold a Sprint Review to demonstrate your work and share your preliminary findings with stakeholders.
*   **Use the right communication method for the right audience.** Provide a detailed bug report for an engineer, a risk-based summary for a manager, and a one-page strategic overview for an executive.
*   **Focus on solutions, not just problems.** Work with your stakeholders to develop practical, actionable recommendations.

By following this process, you can conduct a SaaS security audit that is not only thorough and compliant, but also agile, collaborative, and value-driven.
