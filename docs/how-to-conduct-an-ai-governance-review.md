# How to Conduct an AI Governance Review with the OpenAudit Framework

**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the OpenAudit framework to conduct a review of an organization's AI governance practices. It is designed for assurance professionals, risk managers, and leaders who need to gain assurance over the responsible and ethical use of AI.

This guide will use the **[ai-governance-review](../patterns/ai-governance-review/README.md)** engagement pattern as its foundation.

--- 

## ðŸš€ The Overall Process

Conducting an AI governance review with the OpenAudit framework follows a simple, agile process:

1.  **Understand the Scope:** Review the engagement pattern to understand the key governance domains.
2.  **Plan Your Sprints:** Break the review down into a series of focused, time-boxed sprints.
3.  **Execute the Sprints:** Use the detailed work programs to guide your testing and analysis.
4.  **Communicate Continuously:** Deliver insights and recommendations as you discover them.

## Step 1: Understand the Scope & Key Domains

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the five core domains of the `ai-governance-review` pattern:

1.  **[AI Strategy & Governance](../patterns/ai-governance-review/work-program-domain-ai-strategy-governance.md):** The organization's overall strategy and governance framework for AI.
2.  **[Data Management & Quality](../patterns/ai-governance-review/work-program-domain-data-management-quality.md):** The management and quality of data used in AI systems.
3.  **[Model Development & Validation](../patterns/ai-governance-review/work-program-domain-model-development-validation.md):** The processes for building and validating AI models.
4.  **[Operationalization & Monitoring](../patterns/ai-governance-review/work-program-domain-operationalization-monitoring.md):** The deployment, monitoring, and management of AI models in production.
5.  **[Ethics & Responsible AI](../patterns/ai-governance-review/work-program-domain-ethics-responsible-ai.md):** The ethical and responsible use of AI.

## Step 2: Plan Your Sprints

Break the review into a series of 2-week sprints, each focused on a specific aspect of AI governance.

**Example Sprint Plan:**

*   **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Strategy & Governance Foundation**
    *   **Goal:** To understand the organization's AI strategy and the governance structure in place.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-ai-strategy-governance.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Data & Model Development**
    *   **Goal:** To review the processes for managing data and developing AI models.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-data-management-quality.md` and `work-program-domain-model-development-validation.md` to guide your work.

*   **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Production & Ethics**
    *   **Goal:** To assess how models are managed in production and how the organization addresses ethical considerations.
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the `work-program-domain-operationalization-monitoring.md` and `work-program-domain-ethics-responsible-ai.md` to guide your work.

For more detailed guidance on planning and running sprints, refer to the **[audit-sprint-planning-guide.md](../modules/agile-auditing/audit-sprint-planning-guide.md)**.

## Step 3: Execute the Sprints & Use the Work Programs

For each sprint, use the corresponding work program from the pattern as your guide. These work programs provide:

*   **Key Risks:** To help you focus on the most significant AI-related risks.
*   **Control Objectives:** To define what a "good" control looks like in the context of AI.
*   **Suggested Testing Procedures:** To provide a clear, actionable set of steps for your review.

## Step 4: Communicate for Impact

AI governance is a sensitive and complex topic. Effective communication is critical.

*   **Engage a Broad Range of Stakeholders:** Your stakeholders for this review will include data scientists, engineers, product managers, legal, HR, and senior leadership. Use the **[stakeholder-value-mapping-worksheet.md](../modules/stakeholder-centric/stakeholder-value-mapping-worksheet.md)** to understand their unique perspectives.
*   **Focus on Education:** Many stakeholders may be unfamiliar with the risks of AI. Part of your role will be to educate them on the importance of AI governance.
*   **Use the Right Language:** Avoid technical jargon. Frame your findings and recommendations in clear, business-oriented language.

By following this process, you can conduct an AI governance review that provides valuable insights and helps your organization navigate the exciting and challenging world of artificial intelligence.
