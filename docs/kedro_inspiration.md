# Trust Framework: Kedro-Inspired Architecture

## Overview

This document explores how the Trust framework can adapt best practices from [Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro), the open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable data science code.

## What Kedro Does Well

### 1. Modular, Opinionated Structure
- Standardized project layout: `conf/`, `data/`, `src/`, `pipelines/`
- Makes collaboration and scaling straightforward
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Software Engineering Best Practices
- Enforces clean, testable code
- Versioned pipelines
- Configuration management
- Linting and documentation standards
- Deployment-ready routines

### 3. Pluggable Plugin System
- Kedro-Viz for pipeline visualization
- Extensible data catalogs
- Multiple runners (Airflow, Prefect, Databricks)

## Why Kedro Inspires Trust Framework

1. **Clear project scaffolding** improves contributor onboarding
2. **Modularity** maps perfectly to Trust's three-layer architecture
3. **Enforced best practices** ensure Trust modules stay consistent and testable
4. **Pluggability** enables audit, AI, ESG, or compliance overlays

## Recommended Adaptations for Trust

| Area | Kedro Approach | Trust Implementation |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Project Scaffolding | `src/`, `conf/`, `data/` | `/core/`, `/modules/`, `/patterns/`, `/assets/` |
| Metadata & Config | `catalog.yml`, `conf/` | YAML headers in patterns, industry-specific overlays |
| Versioning & CI | Git, pytest, linting | GitHub Actions, markdownlint, vale |
| Visualization | Kedro-Viz | Trust-Viz for maturity models & control flows |
| Template Generation | `kedro new` CLI | `trust init` tool for pattern scaffolding |
| Community Plugins | Kedro extensions | Trust pattern library, industry extensions |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
- Add GitHub Actions for quality checks
- Implement markdown linting
- Create YAML schema validation
- Set up link integrity checks

### Phase 2: Scaffolding Tool (Next Sprint)
```bash
# Example commands:
trust init engagement "SOC2 Audit 2025"
trust add pattern "cloud-security-controls"
trust validate patterns/
```

### Phase 3: Visualization (Future)
- Web-based Trust-Viz for maturity models
- Interactive control flow diagrams
- Risk heat maps
- Assurance coverage visualization

## Key Differences to Preserve

Unlike Kedro's data pipeline focus, Trust should maintain:

1. **Human-readable markdown** as the primary format
2. **Flexibility** for different audit methodologies  
3. **Lightweight adoption** - no heavy dependencies
4. **Offline-first** operation for privacy

## Pattern Metadata Schema Example

```yaml
pattern:
  name: "Cloud Security Controls"
  version: "1.0.0"
  maturity_levels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  industries: ["technology", "healthcare", "finance"]
  frameworks: ["SOC2", "ISO27001", "NIST"]
  tags: ["cloud", "security", "infrastructure"]
  dependencies:
    - "access-management"
    - "encryption-at-rest"
```

## Benefits for Audit Engagements

1. **Consistency**: All engagements follow the same structure
2. **Reusability**: Patterns can be shared across teams
3. **Quality**: Automated checks ensure documentation standards
4. **Visualization**: See control relationships and coverage gaps
5. **Collaboration**: Clear structure enables team coordination

## Next Steps

1. Create prototype scaffolding script in tools directory
2. Design comprehensive YAML schema for patterns
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
4. Build proof-of-concept visualization tool
5. Document "Getting Started" guide for new users

## Cautions

- **Balance structure with flexibility** - Don't overwhelm small teams
- **Modular onboarding** - Allow "Core only" or "Full Trust" adoption paths  
- **Maintain simplicity** - Audit teams may not be familiar with complex tooling
- **Preserve offline capability** - Many audits happen in secure environments
