# Template: Agile Audit Sprint Plan

**Module:** Agile Auditing
**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This template provides a structured format for planning a single audit sprint (typically 1-3 weeks). It helps the assurance team define a clear, achievable goal, prioritize a backlog of activities, and align on the value to be delivered to stakeholders by the end of the sprint.

## Sprint Plan: `[Sprint Name/Number]`

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sprint Duration:** | *e.g., 2 Weeks* |
| **Start Date:** | `[Date]` |
| **End Date:** | `[Date]` |
| **Assurance Team:** | `[List of team members]` |
| **Key Stakeholders:** | `[List of primary business/tech contacts for this sprint]` |

---

## 1. Sprint Goal

**Objective:** Define a single, concise, and measurable goal for this sprint. What is the most important outcome we want to achieve in the next `[X]` weeks?

**Sprint Goal Statement:**

> *(e.g., "By the end of this sprint, we will deliver a validated data flow diagram and a preliminary risk assessment of the new payment processing vendor, enabling the product team to make a go/no-go decision.")*

---

## 2. Sprint Backlog

**Objective:** List the specific, prioritized tasks (user stories) that the team commits to completing during this sprint to achieve the sprint goal. Each item should be small enough to be completed within the sprint.

| Priority | User Story / Task | Owner | Estimated Effort (e.g., Points/Hours) | Definition of Done |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | *e.g., As a security analyst, I need to review the vendor's SOC 2 report to identify any control gaps.* | `[Name]` | 8 | *SOC 2 report reviewed; key findings summarized and documented.* |
| **High** | *e.g., As an assurance professional, I need to conduct a walkthrough of the payment process with the engineering lead.* | `[Name]` | 4 | *Walkthrough completed; process documented in a draft data flow diagram.* |
| **Medium** | *e.g., As a data analyst, I need to analyze the vendor's API documentation for security and data privacy controls.* | `[Name]` | 6 | *API documentation reviewed; potential risks documented.* |
| **Low** | *e.g., As an assurance professional, I need to schedule follow-up interviews with Legal and Compliance.* | `[Name]` | 2 | *Meetings scheduled.* |

## 3. Capacity Planning

**Objective:** Ensure the team has the capacity to complete the committed backlog.

| Team Member | Available Hours This Sprint | Allocated Hours (from Backlog) | Capacity Buffer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[Name 1]` | | | |
| `[Name 2]` | | | |
| **Total** | | | |

## 4. Key Ceremonies & Meetings

**Objective:** Schedule the key agile ceremonies to ensure the sprint stays on track.

| Ceremony | Date / Time | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sprint Planning** | `[Date]` | To agree on the sprint goal and backlog. |
| **Daily Stand-up** | `[Daily Time]` | To sync on progress, plans, and impediments. |
| **Stakeholder Check-in** | `[Mid-sprint Date]` | To provide a mid-sprint update and gather early feedback. |
| **Sprint Review / Demo** | `[End Date]` | To demonstrate the completed work and value delivered to stakeholders. |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | `[End Date]` | For the assurance team to reflect on the sprint and identify process improvements. |

---

## 5. Risks & Dependencies

**Objective:** Proactively identify any risks or dependencies that could prevent the team from achieving the sprint goal.

| Type (Risk/Dependency) | Description | Mitigation Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Risk* | *Key stakeholder availability for interviews is limited due to holidays.* | *Send interview questions in advance; schedule shorter, more focused sessions.* |
| *e.g., Dependency* | *Access to the vendor's test environment is required to validate API controls.* | *Confirm access with the engineering team on Day 1 of the sprint.* |

---

## 6. Sprint Review Plan

**Objective:** Define what will be demonstrated to stakeholders at the end of the sprint to prove that the goal was met.

*   **What we will demonstrate:**
    1.  *e.g., The validated data flow diagram for the payment process.*
    2.  *e.g., The prioritized list of preliminary risks identified.*
    3.  *e.g., Our recommendation on the go/no-go decision.*

*   **Feedback we are seeking:**
    *   *e.g., "Have we correctly captured the payment process?"*
    *   *e.g., "Are there any risks we have missed?"*
    *   *e.g., "What is the most critical piece of information you need for the next sprint?"*
