# Guide: Planning and Executing an Audit Sprint

**Module:** Agile Auditing
**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step framework for planning and executing a successful audit sprint. A sprint is a short, time-boxed period (typically 2-4 weeks) during which the audit team focuses on completing a small, high-value set of audit activities. This approach replaces the long, linear "fieldwork" phase of a traditional audit with a more focused, adaptive, and value-driven cycle.

## ðŸ”„ The Audit Sprint Lifecycle

The audit sprint follows a simple, repeatable lifecycle:

1.  **Sprint Planning:** Define the goal and scope of the sprint.
2.  **Sprint Execution:** Conduct the audit work, with daily check-ins.
3.  **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate the work completed and gather feedback.
4.  **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the process and identify improvements.

## 1. Sprint Planning

**Objective:** To align the team and stakeholders on a clear, achievable goal for the upcoming sprint.

### Key Activities:

| Activity | Description | Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Define the Sprint Goal** | Write a single, concise sentence that describes the primary outcome of the sprint. | The goal should be ambitious but achievable. *Example: "Validate the effectiveness of user access controls for the new production database."* |
| **Select the Scope** | From the overall audit backlog, select a small number of high-priority risks or controls that align with the sprint goal. | The selected scope should be small enough to be completed within the sprint. It's better to fully complete a small scope than to partially complete a large one. |
| **Deconstruct the Work** | Break down the selected scope into small, concrete tasks that can be completed in 1-2 days. | Each task should have a clear definition of "done." *Example: "Extract user access logs for the last 30 days."* |
| **Estimate the Effort** | Estimate the effort required for each task. This can be done using simple t-shirt sizes (S, M, L) or story points. | The goal of estimation is not to be perfect, but to gauge capacity and prevent over-commitment. |
| **Create the Sprint Backlog** | The list of selected, deconstructed, and estimated tasks becomes the sprint backlog. | The sprint backlog should be visible to the entire team and key stakeholders (e.g., on a physical or digital Kanban board). |

### Who Attends Sprint Planning?
*   **The Audit Team:** The individuals responsible for executing the work.
*   **The Audit Lead / Manager:** Facilitates the meeting and helps to remove roadblocks.
*   **(Optional but Recommended) Key Stakeholders:** The process owners or business partners related to the sprint scope. Their involvement ensures alignment and reduces surprises.

## 2. Sprint Execution

**Objective:** To complete the tasks in the sprint backlog and achieve the sprint goal.

### Key Activities:

| Activity | Description | Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Stand-up** | A brief, 15-minute daily meeting where each team member answers three questions: <br>1. What did I accomplish yesterday? <br>2. What will I accomplish today? <br>3. What is blocking my progress? | This is a status meeting, not a problem-solving session. Blockers are identified and then addressed outside the stand-up. |
| **Backlog Management** | The audit lead continuously updates the sprint backlog to reflect progress and any newly discovered information. | The backlog should be the single source of truth for the sprint's status. |
| **Continuous Communication** | The audit team maintains an open line of communication with stakeholders throughout the sprint. | Avoid waiting until the end of the sprint to share findings. Share insights as they are discovered to get real-time feedback. |

## 3. Sprint Review

**Objective:** To demonstrate the work completed during the sprint and gather feedback from stakeholders.

### Key Activities:

| Activity | Description | Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demonstrate Outcomes** | The audit team presents the actual work completed during the sprint. This is a "show, don't tell" session. | Instead of a PowerPoint presentation, show the actual evidence, test results, or data analysis. |
| **Gather Feedback** | Stakeholders are invited to ask questions and provide feedback on the work presented. | This is a crucial opportunity to validate findings and ensure they are relevant and actionable. |
| **Discuss Next Steps** | Based on the sprint's outcomes, the team and stakeholders discuss potential next steps or adjustments to the overall audit plan. | The feedback from the sprint review is a key input for the next sprint planning session. |

### Who Attends the Sprint Review?
*   The Audit Team
*   The Audit Lead / Manager
*   Key Stakeholders
*   (Optional) Senior leadership or other interested parties.

## 4. Sprint Retrospective

**Objective:** For the audit team to reflect on the sprint process and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Key Activities:

| Activity | Description | Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discuss What Went Well** | The team identifies the things that contributed to the sprint's success. | This helps to reinforce good practices. |
| **Discuss What Could Be Improved** | The team discusses the challenges or roadblocks they faced during the sprint. | The focus should be on process, not people. |
| **Identify Action Items** | The team agrees on 1-2 specific, actionable improvements to implement in the next sprint. | *Example: "We will invite the DevOps lead to our next sprint planning to better understand the data we need."* |

### Who Attends the Sprint Retrospective?
*   This meeting is typically for the **audit team only** to allow for open and honest discussion about the internal team process.
