# Control Design & Maturity 2.0

**TrustOS Functional Module**  
Version 1.0

This module introduces a modern approach to designing, evaluating, and evolving controls in complex, adaptive systems. It replaces outdated maturity concepts with a **cybernetic perspective**—treating controls as dynamic components of a system that can learn, respond, and self-correct.

## 📈 Control Maturity 2.0 Model

| Level | Name                       | Description |
|-------|----------------------------|-------------|
| 0     | **Absent**                 | No control in place. Risk unmanaged. |
| 1     | **Manual & Reactive**      | Human-driven and inconsistent. Triggered only after failures. |
| 2     | **Automated & Preventative** | Static rules enforce baseline behavior. Repeatable but not adaptive. |
| 3     | **Integrated & Monitored** | Controls embedded into business systems with visibility and metrics. |
| 4     | **Adaptive & Data-Informed** | Controls adjust based on input data and behavior over time. |
| 5     | **Cybernetic (Self-Correcting)** | Controls sense, respond, learn, and evolve with minimal human input. |

This model reorients control conversations from “automated vs. manual” to “reactive vs. learning.”

## 🧠 Cybernetic Control Examples

### 1. Dynamic Purchase Approval Loop
- **Current**: Level 4 → **Target**: Level 5  
- Detects procurement anomalies and adjusts sensitivity based on outcomes (e.g., confirmed fraud).

### 2. Cloud Access Auto-Tuner
- **Current**: Level 3 → **Target**: Level 5  
- Auto-revokes unused privileges and learns optimal access levels by job behavior.

### 3. Retention Offer Optimization Engine
- **Current**: Level 4 → **Target**: Level 5  
- Learns from customer behavior and margin impact to refine incentive strategies.

## ✅ Cybernetic Control Checklist

Use this 10-point checklist to evaluate whether a control exhibits cybernetic traits:

1. Generates real-time performance data  
2. Triggers actions automatically  
3. Tracks outcomes of those actions  
4. Adapts behavior based on feedback  
5. Requires human input only for exceptions  
6. Logs false positives/negatives  
7. Adjusts enforcement level based on context  
8. Version-controls its own changes  
9. Self-tunes based on past events  
10. Can self-heal or revert if it causes harm

## 🛠️ Control Improvement Worksheet

To help control owners and auditors guide incremental progress:

- Describe the **current state**
- Assess the **maturity level**
- Identify **gaps and risks**
- Propose **next step upgrades**
- Define **vision for Level 5 (Cybernetic)**
- Assign **ownership, timeline, dependencies**

**Insight is the new independence. Maturity is a system, not a status.**
