## 🧠 Instructions

Use this checklist to evaluate whether a control exhibits self-correcting (cybernetic) traits.  
Each "Yes" answer earns 1 point. Total scores help classify the control's maturity.

| # | Question | Yes | No | Not Sure |
|--:|----------|:---:|:--:|:--------:|
| 1 | Does the control generate real-time data about its own performance? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | Are system actions triggered automatically in response to changing inputs or conditions? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | Does the control track the outcome or impact of those actions (e.g., error reduction, fraud avoided)? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 4 | Does the system adapt its behavior based on those outcomes (e.g., update thresholds or rules)? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 5 | Is human intervention required only when the control fails or hits an exception? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 6 | Are false positives and negatives logged and analyzed to improve future accuracy? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 7 | Can the control escalate or de-escalate its level of enforcement based on ongoing risk context? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 8 | Are control changes or adjustments versioned, monitored, and auditable? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 9 | Has the control logic been tuned at least once in the past year based on feedback loops? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
|10 | Does the system contain a mechanism to revert or self-heal if the adjustment creates harm? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

## 📊 Scoring Guidance

- **8–10 points:**  
  ✅ **Cybernetic Control Confirmed** – This control demonstrates strong self-regulation. Review feedback loops for bias and drift.

- **5–7 points:**  
  ⚙️ **Adaptive Control** – The control shows responsiveness, but lacks closed-loop learning. Recommend telemetry + feedback alignment.

- **3–4 points:**  
  🔄 **Automated Control** – Efficient, but reactive. Introduce sensing and learning mechanisms.

- **0–2 points:**  
  🧱 **Static or Manual Control** – High-risk in dynamic environments. Prioritize redesign.

## 📝 Follow-Up Prompts

- If the control adapts, **how does it learn**? (e.g., supervised, rules-based, reinforcement learning)  
- **What metrics** determine if the control is "working"?  
- **Who reviews or approves** logic changes to the control?  
- What happens when the control **misfires**? Is there a built-in **recovery process**?
