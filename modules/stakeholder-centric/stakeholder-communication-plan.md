### 2. Key Messages

**Objective:** To define the core messages we want to consistently convey throughout the engagement.

| Theme | Key Message |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Engagement Purpose** | *e.g., "Our primary goal is to partner with you to improve the security and efficiency of the new payment system. This is not about finding fault."* |
| **Our Approach** | *e.g., "We will be working in short, collaborative sprints and sharing our observations in near real-time, so there will be no surprises."* |
| **Value Proposition** | *e.g., "By the end of this engagement, you will have a clearer understanding of your risks and a practical, prioritized roadmap for improvement."* |
| **How We Work** | *e.g., "We need your expertise to understand the process, and we are committed to ensuring our work does not disrupt your team's primary objectives."* |

### 3. Communication Matrix

### 4. Feedback & Escalation Protocol

**Objective:** To define a clear and transparent process for handling disagreements and escalating issues.

*   **Process for Validating Observations:**
    1.  *All observations will be shared verbally and informally with the direct process owner first.* 
    2.  *We will provide the underlying data or evidence for every observation.* 
    3.  *We will work collaboratively to ensure the facts and context are correct before documenting anything formally.*

*   **Escalation Path:**
    1.  *If agreement cannot be reached between the assurance professional and the process owner, the issue will be raised to the `[Assurance Lead]` and the `[Primary Contact / Manager]`.* 
    2.  *If still unresolved, the issue will be brought to the `[Executive Sponsor]` for a final decision.*

*   **Date:** `[Date]`
*   **Note:** *This is a living document and will be updated as the engagement evolves. Any significant changes will be discussed with the primary stakeholders.*
