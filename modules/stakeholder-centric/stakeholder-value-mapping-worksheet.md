# Worksheet: Stakeholder & Value Mapping

**Module:** Stakeholder-Centric Auditing
**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This worksheet provides a structured process to identify the key stakeholders for an audit, understand their unique needs and expectations, and explicitly map the audit's objectives and deliverables to provide demonstrable value. This exercise should be completed at the very beginning of the audit planning process.

## 1. Stakeholder Identification & Analysis

**Objective:** To move beyond the default "Audit Committee" stakeholder and identify the full spectrum of individuals or groups who are invested in or impacted by the audit's outcome.

| Stakeholder Group / Individual | Role / Title | What are their primary responsibilities? | Why do they care about this audit? (What's in it for them?) | What is their biggest fear related to this area? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Head of Engineering* | `VP, Engineering` | `Building and maintaining the product` | `Wants to ensure their team is not wasting time on low-value compliance tasks` | `A security breach that damages the product's reputation` |
| *e.g., Product Owner* | `Product Manager` | `Defining the product roadmap and features` | `Wants to understand how security controls might impact the user experience` | `Shipping a feature with a critical vulnerability` |
| *e.g., Head of Sales* | `VP, Sales` | `Driving revenue and closing deals` | `Needs the SOC 2 report to unblock enterprise sales deals` | `Losing a major deal due to a failed security audit` |
| *e.g., Audit Committee Chair* | `Board Member` | `Oversight of risk management` | `Needs assurance that the company is managing key risks effectively` | `A major control failure that leads to financial or reputational loss` |

## 2. Understanding Stakeholder Value

**Objective:** To translate stakeholder needs into a clear definition of "value" for this specific audit. For each key stakeholder identified above, answer the following questions.

### For Stakeholder: `[Insert Stakeholder from above, e.g., Head of Engineering]`

| Question | Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What does a "successful" audit look like from their perspective?** | *e.g., "The audit identifies real-world security gaps we didn't know about, and the recommendations are practical engineering solutions, not just generic compliance-speak."* |
| **What is the most valuable piece of information or insight we could provide them?** | *e.g., "A prioritized list of the top 3 security risks in the new microservice architecture, with data to back it up."* |
| **How do they prefer to receive information? (e.g., formal report, live dashboard, quick summary)** | *e.g., "A live dashboard showing control status and a brief, weekly Slack update. They hate formal PDFs."* |
| **What is their biggest pain point that this audit could potentially help solve?** | *e.g., "The engineering team is constantly debating which security issues to fix first. The audit could provide an objective, risk-based framework for prioritization."* |

## 3. Mapping Audit Activities to Stakeholder Value

**Objective:** To create a direct, explicit link between the work the audit team will do and the value it will create for stakeholders. This transforms the audit plan from a list of tasks into a value delivery plan.

| Audit Objective / Activity | What is the task? | Which Stakeholder(s) does this serve? | How does this create value for them? (Connect back to Section 2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Review the CI/CD pipeline security controls* | `Analyze the configuration of the automated code scanning tools.` | `Head of Engineering` | `Provides objective validation of their security tooling, helping them justify budget and prioritize fixes.` |
| *e.g., Test the incident response plan* | `Conduct a tabletop exercise simulating a major data breach.` | `Head of Engineering, Audit Committee Chair` | `Identifies gaps in the response plan before a real incident occurs, reducing potential reputational and financial damage.` |
| *e.g., Validate user access reviews* | `Analyze access logs for the production database.` | `Head of Sales, Audit Committee Chair` | `Provides the evidence needed for the SOC 2 report, which directly enables sales and provides assurance to the board.` |

## 4. The Value Proposition Statement

**Objective:** To synthesize the above analysis into a single, powerful statement that can be used to communicate the purpose and value of the audit to all stakeholders.

> **This audit will** `[Primary Action, e.g., analyze the security of our new product architecture]` **in order to** `[Primary Outcome, e.g., provide the Engineering team with a prioritized, data-driven roadmap for risk reduction]` **which will help us** `[Connect to Strategic Goal, e.g., accelerate our enterprise sales cycle and protect our brand reputation.]`

**Example Completed Statement:**

> *"This audit will analyze the security of our new product architecture in order to provide the Engineering team with a prioritized, data-driven roadmap for risk reduction, which will help us accelerate our enterprise sales cycle and protect our brand reputation."*
