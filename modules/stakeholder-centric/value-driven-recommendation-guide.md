# Guide: Crafting Value-Driven Recommendations

**Module:** Stakeholder-Centric Assurance
**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This guide provides a structured worksheet to transform a traditional, deficiency-focused "finding" into a positive, compelling, and value-driven recommendation. The goal is to create a narrative that inspires action and collaboration rather than defensiveness.

Use this worksheet for each significant observation or finding in your engagement.

## Recommendation Reframing Worksheet

### 1. The Traditional Finding (The "What Broke" View)

*First, document the finding in the traditional format. This is your internal baseline.* 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Condition:** | *(What is the current state? What is the problem?) e.g., "The user access review process for the finance application was not performed in Q1."* |
| **Criteria:** | *(What is the standard that was not met?) e.g., "The company's IT Security Policy requires quarterly user access reviews for all critical financial applications."* |
| **Cause:** | *(Why did the problem occur?) e.g., "The responsibility for performing the review was not formally assigned after the previous system owner left the company."* |
| **Consequence / Risk:** | *(What is the impact of this problem?) e.g., "Risk of unauthorized or inappropriate access to sensitive financial data remaining undetected."* |

### 2. The Stakeholder-Centric Reframe (The "How We Can Improve" View)

*Now, use the information above to build a new, constructive narrative. The goal is to shift from pointing out a failure to highlighting an opportunity.* 

#### **Step 2a: Identify the Core Opportunity**

*Instead of focusing on the missed requirement, what is the positive future state we want to help the stakeholder achieve?*

**Opportunity Statement:**
> *(e.g., "We have an opportunity to streamline and automate the user access review process to ensure it is both efficient and effective.")*

#### **Step 2b: Articulate the Value Proposition**

*How does achieving this future state benefit the stakeholder and the organization? Focus on positive outcomes.*

| Value Proposition | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reduce Risk** | *e.g., "By automating the review, we can ensure access rights are always current, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches."* |
| **Increase Efficiency** | *e.g., "This will save the finance team approximately 10 hours per quarter by eliminating the need for manual spreadsheet reconciliation."* |
| **Improve Compliance** | *e.g., "An automated process with a clear audit trail will make it much simpler to demonstrate compliance to our external auditors."* |
| **Enable Better Decisions** | *e.g., "This provides managers with a clear, real-time view of who has access to their critical systems."* |

#### **Step 2c: Craft the Collaborative Recommendation**

*Combine the opportunity and the value proposition into a collaborative, forward-looking recommendation. Use "we" language.* 

**Draft Recommendation:**

> **Traditional:** "The department failed to perform the quarterly user access review. Management must ensure reviews are completed in the future."

> **Value-Driven:** "We recommend we partner with the finance and IT teams to implement an automated user access review process. This will not only ensure we meet our compliance obligations but also save the team significant time each quarter and provide stronger, more reliable security over our most sensitive financial data."

### 3. Define Actionable Next Steps

*Finally, propose clear, concrete next steps to make it easy for the stakeholder to engage and move forward.*

| Suggested Next Step | Owner | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., 1. Schedule a 30-minute working session to map the ideal automated workflow.* | `[Assurance Lead]` | `[Next Week]` |
| *e.g., 2. IT to research potential technical solutions within the existing identity management tool.* | `[IT Lead]` | `[In 2 Weeks]` |
| *e.g., 3. Finance to provide a list of all current users to serve as a baseline.* | `[Finance Lead]` | `[Next Week]` |

### ðŸ’¡ Final Litmus Test

Read your reframed recommendation and ask:

*   Does this sound like an accusation or an invitation?
*   Does it focus on past failure or future success?
*   If I were the stakeholder, would I feel defensive or inspired to partner with the assurance team?
