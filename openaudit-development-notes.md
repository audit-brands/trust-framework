**Date:** 2025-07-10

This document records the state of the OpenAudit development work that was paused to avoid collisions with Claude's work on the `trust-cli` main branch.

## Development Branch

The work was being done on the following branch in the `trust-cli` repository:

`feature/openaudit-command`

  fix: update model commands test expectations for new hardware optimizer output

  - Fix test expectations to match new hardware-optimized model recommendation format
  - Update test to look for 'Est. Performance:' instead of 'Expected Performance: fast'
  - Tests now properly validate the enhanced model recommendation system
  ```

## Work in Progress

The development was focused on **Phase 2** of the OpenAudit roadmap: **Tooling Integration & The `openaudit` Persona**.

Specifically, the implementation of the `openaudit new engagement` command within the `trust-cli` was underway.

## Next Steps (When Resumed)

1.  **Complete `openaudit new engagement`:** Finalize the command to ensure it correctly scaffolds a new audit engagement directory.
2.  **Implement `openaudit add pattern`:** Build the command to fetch and integrate predefined patterns into an engagement.
3.  **Develop `openaudit report`:** Create the interactive HTML reporting feature.
