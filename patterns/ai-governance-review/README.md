# Engagement Pattern: AI Governance Review

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

This engagement pattern provides a framework for conducting a governance review of an organization's use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). As organizations increasingly adopt AI/ML, a new set of complex, high-stakes risks emerges, from biased algorithms to data privacy violations and unintended societal impacts. This pattern is designed to provide assurance that the organization is developing and deploying AI in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and aligned with its strategic objectives.
