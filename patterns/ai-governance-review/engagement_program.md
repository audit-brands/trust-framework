# Engagement Program: AI Governance Review

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Scoping

**Objective:** To understand the organization's use of AI and to align with stakeholders on the engagement's objectives.

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | Conduct kick-off meeting to understand the key AI/ML models in use, their business purpose, and the associated risks. | `Meeting minutes`, `Inventory of AI/ML models` |
| **1.2** | Identify the key stakeholders, including the data science, engineering, product, legal, and ethics teams. | `Stakeholder map` |
| **1.3** | Review any existing AI governance policies, standards, and procedures. | `AI ethics policy`, `Model validation standards` |
| **1.4** | Identify all relevant AI regulations and industry best practices (e.g., NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 23894). | `List of applicable regulations` |
| **1.5** | Develop a risk and control matrix (RACM) to identify the key risks and controls to be tested. | `RACM` |

## Phase 2: Fieldwork & Testing

**Objective:** To evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the AI governance framework.

### **Domain 2.1: AI Strategy & Governance**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1.1** | Verify that a cross-functional AI governance committee or equivalent body exists and has a clear charter and responsibilities. | `Committee charter`, `Meeting minutes` |
| **2.1.2** | Review the organization's AI ethics policy and verify that it has been communicated to all relevant employees. | `AI ethics policy`, `Training records` |
| **2.1.3** | Assess the roles and responsibilities for AI governance to ensure they are clearly defined and assigned. | `Roles and responsibilities matrix (RACI)` |

### **Domain 2.2: Model Development & Lifecycle**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.2.1** | Review the model development and validation process. For a sample of models, verify that they have been independently validated and approved before deployment. | `Model validation reports`, `Approval documentation` |
| **2.2.2** | Evaluate the process for monitoring the performance of models in production, including for drift and degradation. | `Model performance monitoring dashboards`, `Alert logs` |
| **2.2.3** | Review the process for decommissioning models to ensure they are retired securely. | `Model decommissioning procedures` |

### **Domain 2.3: Data Governance for AI**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.3.1** | Review the process for sourcing and preparing data for AI models. Verify that the data is accurate, complete, and appropriate for the model's intended use. | `Data quality reports`, `Data lineage documentation` |
| **2.3.2** | Assess the process for identifying and mitigating bias in training data. | `Data bias assessment reports`, `Fairness metrics` |
| **2.3.3** | Verify that sensitive data used in AI models is protected in accordance with the organization's data classification policy. | `Data handling procedures for AI` |

### **Domain 2.4: Ethical AI Principles**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.4.1** | For a sample of AI models, review the documentation to verify that the model's purpose, limitations, and potential impacts are clearly explained. | `Model documentation`, `Transparency reports` |
| **2.4.2** | Assess the process for providing explanations for AI-driven decisions to affected individuals. | `Explainability (XAI) documentation`, `User-facing explanations` |
| **2.4.3** | Review the process for allowing individuals to appeal or contest AI-driven decisions. | `Appeals process documentation` |

## Phase 3: Reporting & Follow-up

**Objective:** To communicate the results of the review and to partner with stakeholders on a plan for maturing the AI governance framework.

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | Use the `value-driven-recommendation-guide.md` to frame the observations as opportunities for improvement. | `Completed recommendation worksheets` |
| **3.2** | Draft the report, focusing on the strategic implications of the observations and the practical steps that can be taken to improve. | `Draft report` |
| **3.3** | Hold a closing meeting to present the results and to agree on a prioritized roadmap for maturing the AI governance framework. | `Final report`, `AI governance roadmap` |
