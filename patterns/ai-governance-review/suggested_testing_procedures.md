# Suggested Testing Procedures: AI Governance Review

**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This document provides a set of specific, practical testing procedures for an AI governance review. These procedures are designed to be adapted to the specific AI/ML models and technologies in use at the organization.

---

### Domain 2.1: AI Strategy & Governance

*   **Test 2.1.1: AI Governance Committee**
    *   **Procedure:** Obtain the last 6 months of meeting minutes from the AI governance committee. Verify that the committee is meeting regularly (e.g., quarterly) and that the minutes reflect substantive discussions on AI risks and ethical considerations.
    *   **Tools:** Confluence, SharePoint, meeting records.

### Domain 2.2: Model Development & Lifecycle

*   **Test 2.2.1: Model Validation**
    *   **Procedure:** For a sample of 3 high-risk AI models, request the model validation documentation. Verify that the validation was performed by an individual or team independent of the model developers and that the results were formally approved by the model owner before deployment.
    *   **Tools:** Model development lifecycle (MDLC) documentation, JIRA/ServiceNow tickets, model validation reports.

*   **Test 2.2.2: Model Performance Monitoring**
    *   **Procedure:** For a sample of 3 models in production, review the performance monitoring dashboards. Verify that key metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, drift) are being tracked and that there is a documented process for responding to alerts.
    *   **Tools:** Datadog, Grafana, custom monitoring dashboards.

### Domain 2.3: Data Governance for AI

*   **Test 2.3.2: Data Bias Assessment**
    *   **Procedure:** For a sample of 3 models that make decisions about individuals, request the data bias assessment report. Verify that the data was tested for bias across relevant demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity) and that any identified biases were mitigated or formally accepted by the AI governance committee.
    *   **Tools:** Fairness assessment tools (e.g., AIF360, Fairlearn), data analysis notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, Colab).

### Domain 2.4: Ethical AI Principles

*   **Test 2.4.2: Explainability**
    *   **Procedure:** For a sample of 3 models, request the documentation that explains how the model works and how it arrives at its decisions. Verify that this documentation is understandable to a non-technical audience.
    *   **Tools:** Model documentation, explainability (XAI) reports (e.g., SHAP, LIME).

*   **Test 2.4.3: Appeals Process**
    *   **Procedure:** For a sample of 3 AI-driven decisions that were appealed by individuals, trace the appeal through the process to verify that it was reviewed by a human and that the individual was provided with a timely response.
    *   **Tools:** Customer support ticketing system, appeals process documentation.
