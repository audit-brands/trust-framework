# Work Program: AI Strategy & Governance

**Pattern:** AI Governance Review
**Domain:** AI Strategy & Governance
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that the organization has a clearly defined AI strategy that is aligned with its business objectives, and that a formal governance structure is in place to oversee the responsible development and deployment of AI.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Lack of Strategic Alignment:** AI initiatives are pursued in an ad-hoc manner without clear connection to business goals, leading to wasted resources and a failure to realize value.
*   **Undefined Ownership & Accountability:** Without a clear governance structure, no one is ultimately accountable for the risks and outcomes of AI systems.
*   **Inadequate Policies & Standards:** The absence of clear policies can lead to inconsistent, risky, and unethical AI practices across the organization.
*   **Resource Misallocation:** The organization invests heavily in AI without the necessary talent, data infrastructure, or risk management capabilities to succeed.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Strategy** | A formal AI strategy exists and is aligned with the overall business strategy. | 1. **Request and review** the organization's documented AI strategy.<br>2. **Verify** that the AI strategy includes a clear statement of objectives, priority use cases, and success metrics.<br>3. **Interview** senior leadership and business unit heads to confirm that the AI strategy supports their goals.<br>4. **Verify** that the AI strategy has been formally approved by the board or an executive committee. |
| **AI Governance Structure** | A formal governance body is responsible for overseeing the organization's AI activities. | 1. **Verify** that an AI governance committee or equivalent body has been established.<br>2. **Review** the charter, membership, and meeting minutes of the governance committee.<br>3. **Verify** that the committee's responsibilities include reviewing and approving high-risk AI projects, overseeing policy development, and monitoring AI-related risks.<br>4. **Confirm** that the committee has representation from key functions, including technology, data science, legal, ethics, and the business. |
| **AI Policies & Standards** | The organization has documented policies and standards for the responsible development and use of AI. | 1. **Verify** that a comprehensive AI policy or set of standards has been developed and approved.<br>2. **Review** the policy to ensure it covers key areas such as data governance, model development, ethical principles, and acceptable use.<br>3. **Verify** that the policy has been communicated to all relevant employees (e.g., data scientists, engineers, product managers).<br>4. **Select a sample** of recent AI projects and verify that they have followed the requirements of the policy. |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Roles and responsibilities for the development, deployment, and management of AI systems are clearly defined. | 1. **Verify** that the organization has defined roles such as "AI Product Owner," "Data Scientist," and "ML Engineer."<br>2. **Review** job descriptions and process documentation to confirm that the responsibilities for managing AI-related risks are clearly assigned.<br>3. **Interview** individuals in these roles to confirm their understanding of their responsibilities. |
| **AI Risk Management** | The organization has a formal process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI-related risks. | 1. **Verify** that the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework has been updated to include AI-specific risks.<br>2. **Review** the process for conducting risk assessments on new AI projects.<br>3. **Verify** that a central inventory or registry of all production AI models is maintained, including their associated risks. |
