# Work Program: Data Management & Quality for AI

**Pattern:** AI Governance Review
**Domain:** Data Management & Quality
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that the data used to train and operate AI models is accurate, complete, and appropriate for its intended use, and that it is sourced and managed in a secure and ethical manner. The quality and integrity of an AI system are fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of its data.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Poor Model Performance:** Inaccurate, incomplete, or noisy training data leads to the development of models that are unreliable and perform poorly in production.
*   **Algorithmic Bias:** The use of biased or unrepresentative data can result in AI models that produce discriminatory or unfair outcomes.
*   **Data Privacy Violations:** The use of sensitive or personal data without proper consent or anonymization can lead to regulatory penalties and a loss of customer trust.
*   **Data Poisoning:** A malicious actor could intentionally corrupt the training data to manipulate the behavior of the AI model.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Sourcing & Provenance** | Data used for AI model development is sourced ethically and its provenance is understood and documented. | 1. **For each AI model,** verify that the source of all training and testing data is documented.<br>2. **Review** the process for acquiring new datasets, including any third-party data, to ensure it is compliant with legal and ethical standards.<br>3. **Verify** that data is labeled with its classification and source, allowing for traceability throughout the data lifecycle.<br>4. **If using synthetic data,** verify that the generation process is well-documented and validated. |
| **Data Quality & Integrity** | Processes are in place to ensure the quality, accuracy, and integrity of data used by AI models. | 1. **Verify** that a formal data quality framework is in place.<br>2. **Interview** data scientists and engineers to understand the process for data pre-processing and cleaning.<br>3. **Select a sample** of training datasets and verify that data quality checks (e.g., for completeness, accuracy, and consistency) have been performed.<br>4. **Verify** that automated data validation is integrated into data pipelines to detect and handle data quality issues. |
| **Data Privacy & Security** | Sensitive and personal data is protected throughout the AI lifecycle. | 1. **Verify** that all data used for AI is handled in accordance with the organization's data classification and handling policies.<br>2. **Verify** that techniques such as anonymization or pseudonymization are used to protect personal data in training datasets.<br>3. **Verify** that access to sensitive data is restricted to only authorized personnel.<br>4. **Confirm** that the use of data for AI purposes is consistent with the organization's privacy notice and any user consents that have been obtained. |
| **Feature Engineering & Selection** | The process for creating and selecting features for AI models is well-defined and controlled. | 1. **Verify** that the feature engineering process is documented for each model.<br>2. **Review** the selection of features to ensure they are relevant to the model's objective and do not introduce unintended bias.<br>3. **Verify** that a feature store or similar mechanism is used to manage and version features, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. |
| **Data for Continuous Monitoring** | The data used to monitor models in production is of the same quality and integrity as the training data. | 1. **Verify** that the data pipelines feeding the production model are subject to the same data quality checks as the training pipelines.<br>2. **Verify** that there is a process for detecting and alerting on data drift, where the statistical properties of the production data diverge from the training data. |
