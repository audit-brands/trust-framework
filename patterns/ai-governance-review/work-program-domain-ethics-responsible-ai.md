# Work Program: Ethics & Responsible AI

**Pattern:** AI Governance Review
**Domain:** Ethics & Responsible AI
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that the organization has a formal framework for ensuring that its AI systems are developed and used in a manner that is ethical, transparent, fair, and aligned with the organization's values and societal expectations. This goes beyond technical correctness to address the human and social impact of AI.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Reputational Damage:** The deployment of an AI system that is perceived as biased, unfair, or unethical can lead to significant public backlash and a loss of customer trust.
*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Regulators are increasingly focused on the ethical implications of AI, and a failure to demonstrate responsible practices can lead to investigations and fines.
*   **Unintended Negative Consequences:** An AI system can have unforeseen negative impacts on individuals, communities, or the environment.
*   **Erosion of Human Agency:** Over-reliance on AI for decision-making can undermine human judgment and accountability.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Ethical Principles** | The organization has a formally defined and communicated set of ethical principles for AI. | 1. **Verify** that a formal document outlining the organization's AI ethical principles (e.g., fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy) has been developed and approved by senior leadership or the board.<br>2. **Verify** that these principles have been communicated to all employees involved in the AI lifecycle.<br>3. **Select a sample** of AI projects and assess whether the project's objectives and design are aligned with the ethical principles. |
| **Ethical Review Board & Process** | A formal process and oversight body exist for reviewing the ethical implications of high-risk AI systems. | 1. **Verify** that an AI ethics committee or a similar review board has been established.<br>2. **Review** the charter and membership of the committee to ensure it has the necessary expertise and independence.<br>3. **Verify** that there is a formal process for submitting high-risk AI projects for ethical review before development begins.<br>4. **Review** the minutes and recommendations from recent ethical reviews and verify that the project teams have addressed the committee's concerns. |
| **Transparency & Disclosure** | The organization is transparent about its use of AI with its customers, users, and other stakeholders. | 1. **Review** the organization's public-facing materials (e.g., privacy notice, terms of service) to verify that they clearly disclose the use of AI in products and services.<br>2. **Verify** that there is a mechanism for users to understand why an AI system made a particular decision about them.<br>3. **Verify** that the organization clearly distinguishes between AI-generated and human-generated content. |
| **Human Oversight & Accountability** | There is meaningful human oversight of all high-risk AI systems, and clear lines of accountability are in place. | 1. **For high-risk AI systems,** verify that there is a human in the loop who can review, override, or intervene in the model's decisions.<br>2. **Verify** that the ultimate accountability for the outcomes of an AI system is clearly assigned to a named individual or role, not to the AI itself.<br>3. **Review** the training provided to human overseers to ensure they understand the capabilities and limitations of the AI system they are managing. |
| **Adversarial & Robustness Testing** | AI systems are tested for their resilience against adversarial attacks and unexpected inputs. | 1. **Verify** that the organization's security testing program includes adversarial testing of AI models (e.g., attempting to trick a computer vision model with intentionally manipulated images).<br>2. **Verify** that models are tested for their robustness and safety when presented with unexpected or out-of-distribution data.<br>3. **Review** the results of any adversarial testing and verify that identified vulnerabilities have been addressed. |
