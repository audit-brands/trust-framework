# Work Program: Model Development & Validation

**Pattern:** AI Governance Review
**Domain:** Model Development & Validation
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that AI models are developed, tested, and validated in a rigorous, systematic, and documented manner to ensure they are accurate, reliable, and fit for their intended purpose before being deployed into production.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Poor Performance:** The model does not achieve the required level of accuracy or performance, leading to poor business outcomes.
*   **Lack of Explainability:** The model is a "black box," making it impossible to understand its decisions, debug issues, or gain stakeholder trust.
*   **Overfitting:** The model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data in the real world.
*   **Bias & Fairness Issues:** The model produces systematically biased or unfair outcomes for certain demographic groups.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Development Methodology** | A standardized methodology is used for developing and documenting AI models. | 1. **Verify** that a formal model development lifecycle (MDLC) is documented and followed by the data science team.<br>2. **Select a sample** of AI models and review their development documentation. Verify that it includes the business problem, the selected algorithm, the training data, and the testing results.<br>3. **Verify** that the source code for all models is stored in a version control system. |
| **Model Performance & Accuracy Testing** | Models are rigorously tested to ensure they meet their performance and accuracy objectives. | 1. **Verify** that for each model, a clear set of performance and accuracy metrics has been defined and approved (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE).<br>2. **Review** the model validation report. Verify that the model was tested against a holdout dataset that was not used during training.<br>3. **Verify** that the model's performance meets the pre-defined acceptance criteria before being approved for deployment.<br>4. **Interview** data scientists to understand the testing and validation process. |
| **Bias & Fairness Testing** | Models are tested to ensure they do not produce biased or unfair outcomes. | 1. **Verify** that the organization has a formal definition of fairness and a set of fairness metrics it uses to evaluate models.<br>2. **Review** the results of bias and fairness testing for key models. Verify that the model's performance is analyzed across different demographic subgroups (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity).<br>3. **Verify** that any identified fairness issues have been mitigated or have a documented risk acceptance.<br>4. **Verify** that the data used to test for bias is representative of the target population. |
| **Model Explainability & Interpretability** | The behavior of the model can be explained and interpreted, especially for high-stakes decisions. | 1. **Verify** that for high-risk models, techniques for model explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME) are used.<br>2. **Review** the model documentation to ensure that it explains how the model works in terms that are understandable to business stakeholders.<br>3. **Verify** that there is a process for providing explanations to customers or users who are impacted by the model's decisions. |
| **Model Validation & Approval** | All models are independently validated and formally approved before being deployed. | 1. **Verify** that there is a formal model validation process that is performed by individuals who are independent of the model development team.<br>2. **Review** the results of the independent validation and verify that all significant issues were addressed.<br>3. **Verify** that all models are formally approved by the AI governance committee or another designated authority before being deployed to production. |
