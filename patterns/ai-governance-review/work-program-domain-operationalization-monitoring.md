# Work Program: Model Operationalization & Monitoring

**Pattern:** AI Governance Review
**Domain:** Operationalization & Monitoring
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that a robust, controlled, and automated process is in place for deploying, monitoring, and managing AI models in production. This ensures that models remain performant, reliable, and secure over time, and that their lifecycle is effectively managed.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Model Degradation:** The performance of the model degrades over time due to changes in the underlying data or environment (concept drift), leading to poor business outcomes.
*   **Lack of Observability:** The inability to monitor the health and performance of the model in production can lead to undetected failures.
*   **Manual, Error-Prone Deployment:** A manual deployment process can introduce errors, lead to inconsistent environments, and slow down the delivery of new models.
*   **Unauthorized Changes:** The lack of change control over production models can lead to unauthorized or untested changes being deployed.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CI/CD for ML (MLOps)** | A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is used to automate the testing and deployment of AI models. | 1. **Verify** that a dedicated MLOps pipeline is in place for deploying models to production.<br>2. **Review** the MLOps pipeline configuration. Verify that it includes automated steps for model testing, validation, and deployment.<br>3. **Verify** that the pipeline is integrated with the source code repository and that all changes to the model or the pipeline itself are version controlled.<br>4. **Verify** that access to deploy to the production environment is restricted. |
| **Model Inventory & Versioning** | A centralized inventory of all production AI models is maintained, and all models are versioned. | 1. **Verify** that a formal model inventory or registry exists and is kept up to date.<br>2. **For each model in the inventory,** verify that it includes key metadata, such as the model owner, version, deployment date, and risk level.<br>3. **Verify** that a consistent versioning scheme is used for all models, and that it is possible to roll back to a previous version of a model if needed. |
| **Production Monitoring** | The performance, health, and behavior of all production models are continuously monitored. | 1. **Verify** that a monitoring solution is in place to track the key performance and operational metrics of each model (e.g., prediction accuracy, latency, error rates).<br>2. **Verify** that alerts are configured to notify the appropriate teams when a model's performance degrades below a pre-defined threshold.<br>3. **Verify** that the monitoring system is configured to detect data drift and concept drift.<br>4. **Review** monitoring dashboards and alert logs for a sample of production models. |
| **Model Governance & Change Management** | All changes to production models follow a formal change management process. | 1. **Verify** that all changes to production models, including retraining or redeployment, require formal approval.<br>2. **Select a sample** of recent model changes and trace them through the change management process, from request to approval and deployment.<br>3. **Verify** that there is a process for periodically reviewing and retiring models that are no longer needed or effective. |
| **Resilience & Scalability** | The infrastructure supporting the AI model is designed to be resilient and to scale with demand. | 1. **Verify** that the model serving infrastructure is deployed in a high-availability configuration (e.g., across multiple availability zones).<br>2. **Verify** that the infrastructure is configured to auto-scale based on prediction volume.<br>3. **Review** the disaster recovery plan for the AI model and its supporting data. |
