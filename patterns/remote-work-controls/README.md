# Engagement Pattern: Remote Work Controls Review

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

This engagement pattern provides a framework for reviewing the key controls and risks associated with a remote or hybrid work environment. The shift away from a traditional office-centric model introduces new security, operational, and cultural challenges. This pattern is designed to provide assurance that the organization has implemented a robust control framework to manage these risks effectively.
