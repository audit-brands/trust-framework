# Engagement Program: Remote Work Controls Review

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Scoping

**Objective:** To understand the organization's remote work policies and technologies and to align with stakeholders on the engagement's objectives.

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | Conduct kick-off meeting to understand the scope of remote work at the organization (e.g., fully remote, hybrid), the key technologies in use, and the primary risks of concern. | `Meeting minutes`, `Remote work policy` |
| **1.2** | Identify the key stakeholders from IT, HR, Legal, and key business units. | `Stakeholder map` |
| **1.3** | Review all existing policies and procedures related to remote work. | `Acceptable use policy`, `Data handling policy`, `Incident response plan` |
| **1.4** | Develop a risk and control matrix (RACM) for the key risks associated with remote work. | `RACM` |

## Phase 2: Fieldwork & Testing

**Objective:** To evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the controls for managing the risks of remote work.

### **Domain 2.1: Endpoint Security**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1.1** | Verify that all company-issued devices are managed by a mobile device management (MDM) or unified endpoint management (UEM) solution. | `MDM/UEM configuration reports` |
| **2.1.2** | For a sample of devices, verify that key security controls are enabled, including disk encryption, anti-malware, and a host-based firewall. | `Screenshots of device configurations` |
| **2.1.3** | Review the policy and controls for the use of personal devices (BYOD), if applicable. | `BYOD policy`, `MDM/UEM reports for personal devices` |

### **Domain 2.2: Network Security**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.2.1** | Review the configuration of the VPN or other remote access solution. Verify that it requires multi-factor authentication (MFA). | `VPN configuration settings` |
| **2.2.2** | Assess the use of split-tunneling on the VPN. If it is enabled, verify that there are compensating controls to mitigate the risk. | `VPN configuration settings`, `Network diagrams` |

### **Domain 2.3: Data Security**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.3.1** | Review the controls for preventing the loss of sensitive data on remote devices, such as data loss prevention (DLP) tools or restrictions on the use of removable media. | `DLP tool configuration`, `Device configuration settings` |
| **2.3.2** | Verify that users are trained on the proper handling of sensitive data when working remotely. | `Training records`, `Data handling policy` |

### **Domain 2.4: HR & People Operations**

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.4.1** | Review the remote work policy to ensure it is clear, comprehensive, and regularly updated. | `Remote work policy` |
| **2.4.2** | Verify that all employees have received training on the remote work policy and the associated security risks. | `Training records` |
| **2.4.3** | Review the support model for remote employees to ensure they have the resources they need to be productive and secure. | `IT support SLAs`, `HR support resources` |

## Phase 3: Reporting & Follow-up

**Objective:** To communicate the results of the review and to partner with stakeholders on a plan for improving the remote work program.

| Step | Procedure | Evidence to Collect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | Use the `value-driven-recommendation-guide.md` to frame the observations as opportunities for improvement. | `Completed recommendation worksheets` |
| **3.2** | Draft the report, focusing on the most significant risks and the most practical recommendations. | `Draft report` |
| **3.3** | Hold a closing meeting to present the results and to agree on a prioritized action plan. | `Final report`, `Management action plan` |
