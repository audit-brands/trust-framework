**Domain:** People & Policy
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that the organization has established and communicated clear policies for remote work, and that it has the programs in place to support the security, well-being, and productivity of its remote workforce.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Policy Gaps:** The lack of clear, formal policies for remote work leads to inconsistent practices and confusion about expectations.
*   **Employee Burnout:** A failure to adapt management practices to a remote context can lead to employee burnout, decreased productivity, and higher attrition.
*   **Insider Threat:** A disgruntled or negligent remote employee can pose a significant security risk.
*   **Lack of Security Awareness:** Remote employees may be more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) if they do not receive targeted security awareness training.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |

| **Remote Work Policy** | A formal, comprehensive remote work policy has been established and communicated to all employees. | 1. **Verify** that a formal remote work policy exists and has been approved by HR, Legal, and IT leadership.<br>2. **Review** the policy to ensure it clearly defines eligibility for remote work, expectations for work hours and availability, and requirements for the home office environment.<br>3. **Verify** that all employees have formally acknowledged that they have read and understood the policy. |
| **Security Awareness Training** | Employees receive regular security awareness training that is tailored to the risks of a remote work environment. | 1. **Verify** that the organization's security awareness training program includes specific modules on remote work risks (e.g., phishing, home network security, protecting physical devices).<br>2. **Review** training completion records to verify that all employees have completed the required training.<br>3. **Verify** that periodic phishing simulation campaigns are conducted to test employee awareness. |
| **Onboarding & Offboarding** | The processes for onboarding new employees and offboarding departing employees have been adapted for a remote context. | 1. **Review** the remote onboarding process. Verify that it includes secure equipment provisioning and a structured orientation to company culture and tools.<br>2. **Review** the remote offboarding process. Verify that it includes a clear process for recovering all company assets (laptops, phones, etc.) in a timely manner.<br>3. **Verify** that access is terminated on the employee's last day, as tested in the IAM work program. |
| **Performance & Well-being** | Management practices have been adapted to effectively manage and support the performance and well-being of remote employees. | 1. **Interview** a sample of managers to understand how they manage performance and maintain team cohesion in a remote setting.<br>2. **Verify** that the organization provides resources to support remote employee well-being (e.g., mental health resources, stipends for home office equipment).<br>3. **Review** employee engagement survey results to identify any trends or challenges related to remote work. |
