# Engagement Pattern: SaaS Security Audit

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

This engagement pattern provides a comprehensive, modern framework for conducting a security audit of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application. It is designed to move beyond traditional compliance checklists and focus on the key architectural and operational risks inherent in cloud-native environments.

This pattern leverages the principles and tools from the core OpenAudit modules to deliver a risk-focused, agile, and stakeholder-centric audit.
