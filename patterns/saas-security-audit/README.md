# Engagement Pattern: SaaS Security Audit

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

This engagement pattern provides a comprehensive, modern framework for conducting a security audit of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application. It is designed to move beyond traditional compliance checklists and focus on the key architectural and operational risks inherent in cloud-native environments.

This pattern leverages the principles and tools from the core OpenAudit modules to deliver a risk-focused, agile, and stakeholder-centric audit.

## üìù Pattern Metadata

  owner: "OpenAudit Community"

# Defines the core modules that this pattern is built upon
modules:
  - name: "risk-intelligence"
    objectives:
      - "Identify and monitor key security risk signals (e.g., vulnerability scan results, anomalous login attempts)."
  - name: "agile-auditing"
    objectives:
      - "Structure the audit into focused sprints (e.g., 'Infrastructure Security', 'Application Security')."
      - "Foster continuous collaboration with Engineering and DevOps teams."
  - name: "stakeholder-centric"
    objectives:
      - "Align audit activities with the security expectations of customers and partners."
      - "Deliver actionable insights to Engineering teams, not just a list of findings."

# Defines the key risk areas and control domains to be covered
scope:
  domains:
    - "Infrastructure & Cloud Configuration"
    - "Application & Code Security"
    - "Data Security & Privacy"
    - "Identity & Access Management"
    - "Incident Response & Business Continuity"
```

## üìö Included Resources

This pattern is composed of a series of work programs and checklists for each of the core domains.

*   **[work-program-domain-infra-cloud.md](work-program-domain-infra-cloud.md):** A work program for auditing the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure.
*   **[work-program-domain-app-code-security.md](work-program-domain-app-code-security.md):** A work program for auditing the security of the application code and software supply chain.
*   **[work-program-domain-data-security-privacy.md](work-program-domain-data-security-privacy.md):** A work program for auditing data security controls and privacy practices.
*   **[work-program-domain-iam.md](work-program-domain-iam.md):** A work program for auditing identity and access management controls.
*   **[work-program-domain-incident-response.md](work-program-domain-incident-response.md):** A work program for auditing incident response and business continuity capabilities.

## üß† Applying the Control Maturity Model

In addition to the detailed work programs, practitioners should use the **[Control Maturity & Design Assessment](../../core/control-maturity-and-design-assessment.md)** tool from our core library to evaluate the key controls within this domain.

For each significant control identified during the audit (e.g., the process for vulnerability scanning, the user access review process), complete the worksheet to:

1.  **Assess the current maturity level** of the control.
2.  **Identify key gaps and risks** in its current design.
3.  **Define a clear path for improvement** toward a more automated and adaptive state.

This provides a powerful, forward-looking perspective that moves beyond simple compliance checking and helps to drive real improvement in the organization's security posture.
