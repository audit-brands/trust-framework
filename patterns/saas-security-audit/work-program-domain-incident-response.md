# Work Program: Incident Response & Business Continuity

**Pattern:** SaaS Security Audit
**Domain:** Incident Response & Business Continuity
**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Objective

To verify that the organization has a documented, tested, and effective plan to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents and business disruptions, minimizing the potential impact on customers and the business.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Risks

*   **Delayed Detection:** The inability to quickly detect a security incident allows an attacker to dwell in the environment for an extended period, increasing the potential damage.
*   **Chaotic Response:** The lack of a clear, well-rehearsed incident response plan leads to a disorganized and ineffective response, exacerbating the impact of the incident.
*   **Extended Downtime:** The inability to quickly recover from a service disruption or data loss event can lead to significant revenue loss and reputational damage.
*   **Poor Communication:** The failure to communicate effectively with internal stakeholders, customers, and regulators during an incident can destroy trust.

## üî¨ Work Program & Testing Procedures

| Control Area | Control Objective | Suggested Testing Procedures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incident Response Plan & Team** | A formal incident response (IR) plan is documented, and a dedicated IR team is established. | 1. **Verify** that a formal, board-approved IR plan exists and is reviewed at least annually.<br>2. **Verify** that the IR plan defines the phases of incident response (e.g., Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Mortem).<br>3. **Verify** that a dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is established with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.<br>4. **Verify** that contact information for all IR team members and key stakeholders is maintained and accessible. |
| **Incident Detection & Analysis** | The organization has the capability to detect and analyze potential security incidents in a timely manner. | 1. **Verify** that a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or equivalent log analysis solution is in place and configured to collect logs from all critical systems.<br>2. **Verify** that automated alerts are configured for high-priority security events.<br>3. **Select a sample** of recent security alerts and verify that they were triaged and investigated in accordance with the IR plan.<br>4. **Interview** security analysts to understand the process they follow for analyzing and escalating potential incidents. |
| **Incident Response Testing** | The incident response plan is periodically tested to ensure its effectiveness. | 1. **Verify** that the organization conducts regular IR tabletop exercises (at least annually) involving key technical and business stakeholders.<br>2. **Review** the reports and lessons learned from recent IR tests.<br>3. **Verify** that action items identified during the tests are tracked to completion.<br>4. **For mature organizations,** verify that more advanced testing (e.g., red team exercises) is performed. |
| **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)** | The organization has a plan to recover critical business functions and IT systems in the event of a major disruption. | 1. **Verify** that a formal BC/DR plan is documented and approved.<br>2. **Verify** that a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) has been performed to identify critical systems and define Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).<br>3. **Verify** that the BC/DR plan is tested at least annually.<br>4. **Review** the results of the latest BC/DR test and verify that the organization was able to meet its defined RTOs and RPOs. |
| **Stakeholder & Customer Communication** | A plan is in place for communicating with internal stakeholders, customers, and regulators during and after an incident. | 1. **Verify** that the IR plan includes a formal communication plan.<br>2. **Verify** that pre-approved communication templates exist for different types of incidents and audiences.<br>3. **Verify** that the plan defines who is authorized to speak to the public and the media.<br>4. **During a review of a past incident,** assess whether the communication was timely, transparent, and effective. |
