# Strategy: Community Internationalization & Growth

**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision & Guiding Principles

### Vision

To establish the OpenAudit framework as a truly **global** standard, not one dominated by a single region or language. Our goal is to cultivate a diverse, inclusive community where assurance, risk, and control professionals from all over the world can collaborate, share knowledge, and build the future of their profession together.

### Guiding Principles

Our international growth will be guided by four key principles:

1.  **Start with Language:** The first and most important step to building a global community is to make the framework accessible. Translation is the foundation of our internationalization strategy.
2.  **Empower Local Leaders:** We will not manage the global community from the center. We will actively identify, empower, and support local community leaders (or "Chapter Leads") to build and manage their own local communities.
3.  **Think Global, Act Local:** While the core principles of the OpenAudit framework will remain consistent globally, we will encourage and support the development of region-specific engagement patterns and modules that address local laws, regulations, and business customs.
4.  **Community-Driven Governance:** As the community grows, the governance of the framework will evolve to include representation from our international chapters, ensuring that all voices are heard.

## ðŸ“ˆ Phased Rollout Plan

Our international expansion will follow a three-phase approach, moving from a centralized translation effort to a decentralized, community-led global ecosystem.

### Phase 1: Foundational Translations (The "Seed")

*   **Goal:** To translate the core components of the `trust-framework` into a small number of key languages to seed the international community.
*   **Target Languages (Initial):** Spanish and German, chosen for their large and active assurance communities.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Use a high-quality AI-powered translation service to create the initial versions of the core modules and key patterns.
    2.  Recruit native-speaking volunteers from the community to review, correct, and refine the AI-generated translations to ensure accuracy and cultural nuance.
*   **Key Deliverable:** An `i18n/` (internationalization) directory within the `trust-framework` repository to house the translated content.

### Phase 2: Community-Led Translation & Local Chapters (The "Growth")

*   **Goal:** To build a scalable, community-driven process for translating content into new languages and to formally establish the first local community chapters.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Create a clear set of guidelines (`TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md`) on how community members can propose and contribute translations for new languages.
    2.  Formally recognize "OpenAudit Chapters" (e.g., "OpenAudit Brazil," "OpenAudit Japan") led by community volunteers.
*   **Key Deliverable:** A `CHAPTER_GUIDE.md` that outlines the process and benefits of starting and running an official local chapter.

### Phase 3: Global Governance & Ecosystem (The "Scale")

*   **Goal:** To create a global governance model that gives a formal voice to the different regional communities.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Establish a "Global Council" with representation from each of the major local chapters.
    2.  This council will be responsible for making decisions that impact the entire framework, such as approving new core modules or major changes to the governance model.
*   **Key Deliverable:** A formal charter for the Global Council.

## ðŸš€ Actionable Next Steps

To initiate Phase 1, we will take the following immediate actions:

1.  **Create the `i18n` Directory:** Establish the initial directory structure within the `trust-framework` repository to house translated content.
2.  **Perform Initial Translation:** Use an AI translation service to generate the initial Spanish and German versions of the core modules.
3.  **Call for Volunteers:** Announce the translation effort and put out a public call for native-speaking volunteers to help review and refine the translations.
4.  **Draft the `CHAPTER_GUIDE.md`:** Create the initial draft of the guide for starting a local chapter to prepare for Phase 2.
