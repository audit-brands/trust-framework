# Strategy: OpenAudit Server Technical Specification

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Vision & Objective

**Vision:** To create an open-source, self-hostable server that directly competes with expensive, proprietary GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tools. The OpenAudit Server will serve as the central hub for assurance teams, aggregating the results from individual `trust-cli` engagements to provide enterprise-level dashboards, audit planning, and resource management.

**Objective:** To draft the initial technical specification and high-level architecture for the OpenAudit Server, providing a clear roadmap for its future development.

--- 

## üîë Core Features (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the core functionality required to aggregate and visualize audit work.

1.  **User & Organization Management:**
    *   Multi-tenant support for different organizations.
    *   User authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) within an organization (e.g., Admin, Manager, Practitioner).

2.  **Engagement Aggregation:**
    *   A secure API endpoint for the `trust-cli` to push engagement data to the server.
    *   A central repository to store and manage all audit engagements for an organization.

3.  **Centralized Dashboarding:**
    *   A high-level dashboard showing the status of all ongoing and completed engagements.
    *   The ability to drill down into a specific engagement to view its details, findings, and evidence.

4.  **API for `trust-cli`:**
    *   A well-documented REST or GraphQL API to support integration with the `trust-cli`.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

The server will be designed as a modern, three-tier web application.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React with TypeScript.
    *   **Styling:** A component library like Material-UI or Chakra UI to ensure a consistent and professional look and feel.
    *   **Key Libraries:** A data-fetching library like React Query or SWR for managing API interactions.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Node.js with a TypeScript framework like NestJS or Fastify. This choice aligns well with the existing TypeScript expertise in the `trust-cli` project.
    *   **API:** A RESTful API will be the primary interface for the frontend and the `trust-cli`.

*   **Database:**
    *   **Type:** A relational database is required to manage the structured data of the application.
    *   **Choice:** PostgreSQL is the recommended choice due to its robustness, feature set, and strong open-source community.
    *   **ORM:** An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Prisma or TypeORM will be used to interact with the database in a type-safe way.

*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Method:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used to secure the API.
    *   **Provider:** An open-source authentication solution like Keycloak or a managed service could be used to handle user authentication and identity management.

## üì¶ Data Model (Preliminary)

The database schema will be designed around these core entities:

*   `Organization`: The top-level tenant.
*   `User`: Belongs to an organization, has a specific role.
*   `Engagement`: The central object for an audit, linked to an organization.
*   `Finding`: A specific issue or observation within an engagement.
*   `Pattern`: A record of the engagement pattern used for an engagement.
*   `Module`: A record of the core modules applied.

--- 

## üîÑ Integration with `trust-cli`

The `trust-cli` will be enhanced with new commands to interact with the server:

1.  `openaudit login <server_url>`: To authenticate the CLI with the OpenAudit Server and store the JWT locally.
2.  `openaudit sync`: To push the current engagement data (status, findings, etc.) from the local machine to the server.

This allows practitioners to continue using the local-first workflow they prefer, while providing a mechanism to centralize and share their work with the broader team.

--- 

## üìà Phased Rollout Plan

Development will be broken down into four distinct phases:

*   **Phase 1: Core Backend & API:**
    *   Develop the database schema and data models.
    *   Build the core REST API for users, organizations, and engagements.
    *   Implement the authentication system.

*   **Phase 2: MVP Frontend:**
    *   Build the user login and registration flows.
    *   Create the main dashboard for viewing all engagements.
    *   Build the detailed view for a single engagement.

*   **Phase 3: `trust-cli` Integration:**
    *   Implement the `openaudit login` and `openaudit sync` commands in the `trust-cli`.
    *   Thoroughly test the end-to-end data synchronization process.

*   **Phase 4: Advanced Features:**
    *   Implement more advanced GRC features, such as audit planning, resource management, and advanced analytics.
    *   Develop a plugin system for extending the server's functionality.
