# Strategy: Public Q&A Platform

**Version:** 1.0

---

## üéØ Vision & Objective

**Vision:** To create the "Wikipedia for Auditors"‚Äîthe central, indispensable hub for practitioner knowledge, questions, and collaboration within the OpenAudit ecosystem.

**Objective:** To build a public, community-driven Q&A platform that allows assurance, risk, and control professionals to ask practical questions, share expert answers, and build a searchable, canonical knowledge base. This platform is a critical component of our community strategy, designed to foster engagement, solve real-world problems, and provide a new channel for competency recognition.

## üîë Key Features (The MVP)

The initial version of the platform should focus on the core Q&A experience:

1.  **Core Q&A Functionality:**
    *   Users can ask a question with a title, detailed body (supporting Markdown), and tags.
    *   Users can write answers to questions.
    *   Users can write comments on both questions and answers.

2.  **Voting System:**
    *   Users can vote up or down on both questions and answers to surface the best content.
    *   The original poster can accept one answer as the "correct" or most helpful one.

3.  **User Profiles & Reputation:**
    *   Every user has a public profile.
    *   A simple reputation system based on upvotes and accepted answers. This will be the foundation for the **[Competency Registry](competency-registry.md)**.

4.  **Tagging & Search:**
    *   All questions must be tagged with relevant keywords (e.g., `soc2`, `cloud-security`, `risk-assessment`).
    *   Robust, full-text search of all questions and answers.

5.  **Moderation Tools:**
    *   Basic tools for community moderators to edit, close, or delete low-quality or inappropriate content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack Options

We have three primary options for implementing this platform. Each has significant trade-offs.

### Option 1: Self-Hosted Open Source (e.g., Discourse)

*   **Description:** Deploy a mature, open-source forum and Q&A platform like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) on our own infrastructure.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Full Control:** We own the data and have full control over the software and its features.
    *   **Extensible:** Discourse has a robust plugin architecture.
    *   **Mature & Battle-Tested:** It's a well-known, reliable platform.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High Operational Overhead:** Requires us to manage the infrastructure, security, updates, and maintenance.
    *   **Cost:** While the software is free, infrastructure and operational costs can be significant.

### Option 2: SaaS Q&A Platform (e.g., Stack Overflow for Teams - Business Plan)

*   **Description:** Use a managed, third-party service to host our community.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Low Operational Overhead:** The vendor manages all infrastructure and maintenance.
    *   **Fast to Market:** We could launch a community in days.
    *   **Familiar UX:** Users are already familiar with the Stack Overflow interface.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High Cost:** These services are often expensive, with per-user pricing models.
    *   **Lack of Control:** We are dependent on the vendor's roadmap and features. Data ownership and portability can be a concern.
    *   **Limited Integration:** Deep integration with our own ecosystem (`trust-cli`, competency registry) may be difficult or impossible.

### Option 3: Custom Build

*   **Description:** Build our own Q&A platform from scratch.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Complete Control & Deep Integration:** The platform could be perfectly tailored to our needs, with seamless integration into the rest of the OpenAudit ecosystem.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Extremely High Effort:** This would be a massive undertaking, requiring a dedicated development team and significant resources.
    *   **Slow to Market:** It would take many months, if not years, to build a mature, stable platform.
    *   **Reinventing the Wheel:** We would be spending time building features that already exist in mature open-source projects.

## üìà Recommendation & Phased Rollout

**Recommendation:** **Option 1: Self-Hosted Discourse.**

This option provides the best balance of control, cost, and community ownership, which is highly aligned with the OpenAudit philosophy. The operational overhead is a manageable challenge.

### Phased Rollout Plan:

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Next 4-6 Weeks)**
    1.  **Deploy Discourse:** Set up a production-ready Discourse instance on a cloud provider (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS).
    2.  **Basic Configuration:** Configure the basic settings, categories, and branding for the OpenAudit community.
    3.  **Establish Moderation Guidelines:** Create the initial `Code of Conduct` and guidelines for community moderation.
    4.  **Private Beta:** Invite a small group of founding practitioners to start using the platform and provide feedback.

*   **Phase 2: Integration & Gamification (Following Phase 1)**
    1.  **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Explore options for a unified login across the OpenAudit ecosystem.
    2.  **Competency Integration:** Develop a process or plugin to link activity on the Q&A platform (e.g., upvotes, accepted answers) to the **[Competency Registry](competency-registry.md)**.
    3.  **Public Launch:** Open the platform to the general public.

*   **Phase 3: `trust-cli` Integration (Following `trust-cli` v2 Launch)**
    1.  **`openaudit help --ask`:** Build the CLI command to allow users to ask questions on the platform directly from their terminal.
    2.  **`openaudit search`:** Build a command to search the Q&A platform for answers to common problems.
