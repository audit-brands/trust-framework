# Trust Tools

Technical implementations that embody Trust principles of privacy, transparency, and trust-by-design.

## Available Tools

### ðŸ”§ [trust-cli](trust-cli/)
A local-first AI CLI assistant that embodies Trust privacy and transparency principles. Built as a fork of Google's Gemini CLI, trust-cli replaces cloud API calls with local GGUF model inference for complete privacy and offline capability.

**Active Development**: https://github.com/audit-brands/trust-cli

## Tool Philosophy

All Trust tools share common principles:

- **Privacy-first**: All processing happens locally when possible
- **Transparency**: Open source, auditable implementations  
- **Trust-by-design**: Security and privacy built into the architecture
- **Community-driven**: Open contribution and governance model

## Contributing

New tools that align with Trust principles are welcome. See the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../core/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Roadmap

Additional tools planned:
- Local model management utilities
- Privacy-focused development workflows
- Trust verification and audit tools

**Trust is a system. These tools help build it.**
